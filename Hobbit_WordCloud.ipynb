      "pretending to take no more notice of the old \n",
      "man. He had decided that he was not quite his \n",
      "sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old \n",
      "man did not move. He stood leaning on his \n",
      "stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying \n",
      "anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and \n",
      "even a little cross. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t \n",

      "\n",
      "try over The Hill or across The Water.” By this \n",

      "\n",
      "“What a lot of things you do use Good \n",
      "morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that \n",

      "good till I move off.” \n",
      "\n",

      "lasses going off into the Blue for mad \n",
      "adventures? Anything from climbing trees to \n",
      "visiting elves — or sailing in ships, sailing to \n",
      "other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite \n",

      "give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you \n",

      "that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his \n",
      "round green door, and shut it as quickly as he \n",

      "wizards. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he \n",

      "two and a drink of something would do him \n",
      "good after his fright. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf in the meantime was still standing \n",
      "outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. \n",
      "After a while he stepped up, and with the spike \n",
      "on his staff scratched a queer sign on the \n",
      "hobbit’s beautiful green front-door. Then he \n",
      "strode away, just about the time when Bilbo \n",
      "was finishing his second cake and beginning to \n",
      "think that he had escaped adventures very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day he had almost forgotten about \n",
      "Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, \n",
      "unless he put them down on his Engagement \n",
      "Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. \n",
      "Yesterday he had been too flustered to do \n",
      "anything of the kind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just before tea-time there came a \n",
      "tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then \n",
      "he remembered! He rushed and put on the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and \n",
      "an extra cake or two, and ran to the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry to keep you waiting!” he was \n",
      "going to say, when he saw that it was not \n",
      "Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard \n",
      "tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes \n",
      "under his dark-green hood. As soon as the \n",
      "door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if \n",
      "he had been expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest \n",
      "peg, and “Dwalin at your service!” he said with \n",
      "a low bow. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit, \n",
      "too surprised to ask any questions for the \n",
      "moment. When the silence that followed had \n",
      "become uncomfortable, he added: “I am just \n",
      "about to take tea; pray come and have some \n",
      "with me.” A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it \n",
      "kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited \n",
      "dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall \n",
      "without a word of explanation? \n",
      "\n",
      "They had not been at table long, in fact they \n",
      "had hardly reached the third cake, when there \n",
      "came another even louder ring at the bell. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off he \n",
      "went to the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "“So you have got here at last!” That was \n",
      "what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. \n",
      "But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard \n",
      "and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside \n",
      "as soon as the door was open, just as if he had \n",
      "been invited. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I see they have begun to arrive already,” he \n",
      "said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green \n",
      "hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, \n",
      "and “Balin at your service!” he said with his \n",
      "hand on his breast. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was \n",
      "not the correct thing to say, but they have \n",
      "begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He \n",
      "liked visitors, but he liked to know them before \n",
      "they arrived, and he preferred to ask them \n",
      "himself. He had a horrible thought that the \n",
      "cakes might run short, and then he — as the \n",
      "host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however \n",
      "painful — he might have to go without. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Come along in, and have some tea!” he \n",
      "managed to say after taking a deep breath. \n",
      "\n",
      "“A little beer would suit me better, if it is all \n",
      "the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with \n",
      "the white beard. “But I don’t mind some cake — \n",
      "seed-cake, if you have any.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his \n",
      "own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, \n",
      "too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then \n",
      "to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed- \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his \n",
      "after-supper morsel. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he got back Balin and Dwalin were \n",
      "talking at the table like old friends (as a matter \n",
      "of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down \n",
      "the beer and the cake in front of them, when \n",
      "loud came a ring at the bell again, and then \n",
      "another ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as \n",
      "he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It \n",
      "was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, \n",
      "silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of \n",
      "them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they \n",
      "hopped, as soon as the door began to open — \n",
      "Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What can I do for you, my dwarves?” he \n",
      "said. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Kili at your service!” said the one. “And \n",
      "Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off \n",
      "their blue hoods and bowed. \n",
      "\n",
      "“At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo, \n",
      "remembering his manners this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,” said \n",
      "Kili. “Let us join the throng!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. “I don’t like \n",
      "the sound of that. I really must sit down for a \n",
      "minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.” \n",
      "He had only just had a sip — in the corner, while \n",
      "the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "about mines and gold and troubles with the \n",
      "goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and \n",
      "lots of other things which he did not understand, \n",
      "and did not want to, for they sounded much too \n",
      "adventurous — when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, \n",
      "his bell rang again, as if some naughty little \n",
      "hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Someone at the door!” he said, blinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Some four, I should say by the sound,” said \n",
      "Fili. “Besides, we saw them coming along \n",
      "behind us in the distance.” \n",
      "\n",
      "The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall \n",
      "and put his head in his hands, and wondered \n",
      "what had happened, and what was going to \n",
      "happen, and whether they would all stay to \n",
      "supper. Then the bell rang again louder than \n",
      "ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not \n",
      "four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had \n",
      "come along while he was wondering in the hall. \n",
      "He had hardly turned the knob, before they were \n",
      "all inside, bowing and saying “at your service” \n",
      "one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin \n",
      "were their names; and very soon two purple \n",
      "hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white \n",
      "hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they \n",
      "marched with their broad hands stuck in their \n",
      "gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it \n",
      "had almost become a throng. Some called for \n",
      "ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was \n",
      "kept very busy for a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big jug of coffee had just been set in the \n",
      "hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the \n",
      "dwarves were starting on a round of buttered \n",
      "scones, when there came — a loud knock. Not a \n",
      "ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beautiful \n",
      "green door. Somebody was banging with a \n",
      "stick! \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, \n",
      "and altogether bewildered and bewuthered — \n",
      "this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever \n",
      "remembered. He pulled open the door with a \n",
      "jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. \n",
      "More dwarves, four more! And there was \n",
      "Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and \n",
      "laughing. He had made quite a dent on the \n",
      "beautiful door; he had also, by the way, \n",
      "knocked out the secret mark that he had put \n",
      "there the morning before. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like \n",
      "you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, \n",
      "and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me \n",
      "introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially \n",
      "Thorin!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and \n",
      "Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up \n",
      "two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and \n",
      "also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously \n",
      "important dwarf, in fact no other than the great \n",
      "Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all \n",
      "pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, \n",
      "Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing \n",
      "Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin \n",
      "indeed was very haughty, and said nothing \n",
      "about service', but poor Mr. Baggins said he \n",
      "was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted \n",
      "“pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking \n",
      "at the row of thirteen hoods — the best \n",
      "detachable party hoods — and his own hat \n",
      "hanging on the pegs. “Quite a merry gathering! I \n",
      "hope there is something left for the late-comers \n",
      "to eat and drink! What’s that? Tea! No thank \n",
      "you! A little red wine, I think for me.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“And for me,” said Thorin. \n",
      "\n",
      "“And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” said \n",
      "Bifur. \n",
      "\n",
      "“And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur. \n",
      "\n",
      "“And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur. \n",
      "\n",
      "“And more cakes — and ale — and coffee, if \n",
      "you don’t mind,” called the other dwarves \n",
      "through the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!” \n",
      "Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped \n",
      "off to the pantries. “And just bring out the cold \n",
      "chicken and pickles!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seems to know as much about the inside \n",
      "of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr. \n",
      "Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, \n",
      "and was beginning to wonder whether a most \n",
      "wretched adventure had not come right into his \n",
      "house. By the time he had got all the bottles and \n",
      "dishes and knives and forks and glasses and \n",
      "plates and spoons and things piled up on big \n",
      "trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the \n",
      "face, and annoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Confusticate and bebother these \n",
      "dwarves!” he said aloud. “Why don’t they come \n",
      "and lend a hand?” Lo and behold! there stood \n",
      "Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and \n",
      "Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could \n",
      "say knife they had whisked the trays and a \n",
      "couple of small tables into the parlour and set \n",
      "out everything afresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the \n",
      "thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a \n",
      "stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his \n",
      "appetite was quite taken away), and trying to \n",
      "look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not \n",
      "in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and \n",
      "ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At \n",
      "last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo \n",
      "made a move to collect the plates and glasses. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he \n",
      "said in his politest unpressing tones. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We \n",
      "shan’t get through the business till late, and we \n",
      "must have some music first. Now to clear up!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon the twelve dwarves — not Thorin, \n",
      "he was too important, and stayed talking to \n",
      "Gandalf — jumped to their feet, and made tall \n",
      "piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting \n",
      "for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with \n",
      "a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the \n",
      "hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with \n",
      "fright: “please be careful!” and “please, don’t \n",
      "trouble! I can manage.” But the dwarves only \n",
      "started to sing: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chip the glasses and crack the plates! \n",
      "\n",
      "Blunt the knives and bend the forks! \n",
      "That’s i/i hat Bilbo Baggins hates- \n",
      "Smash the bottles and burn the corks! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! \n",
      "\n",
      "Pour the milk on the pantry floor! \n",
      "Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! \n",
      "Splash the 1/1 ine on every door! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dump the crocks in a boiling bow/; \n",
      "\n",
      "Pound them up with a thumping pole; \n",
      "And when you’ve finished, if any are \n",
      "whole, \n",
      "\n",
      "Send them down the hall to roll! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates! \n",
      "\n",
      "So, carefully! carefully with the plates! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course they did none of these \n",
      "dreadful things, and everything was cleaned \n",
      "and put away safe as quick as lightning, while \n",
      "the hobbit was turning round and round in the \n",
      "middle of the kitchen trying to see what they \n",
      "were doing. Then they went back, and found \n",
      "Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a \n",
      "pipe. He was blowing the most enormous \n",
      "smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it \n",
      "went — up the chimney, or behind the clock on \n",
      "the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round \n",

      "\n",
      "“We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, \n",

      "before the break of day start on our long \n",
      "journey, a journey from which some of us, or \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may \n",
      "never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object \n",
      "is, I take it, well known to us all. To the \n",
      "estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or \n",
      "two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be \n",
      "right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the \n",
      "exact situation at the moment may require a \n",
      "little brief explanation — ” \n",
      "\n",
      "This was Thorin’s style. He was an \n",
      "important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he \n",
      "would probably have gone on like this until he \n",
      "was out of breath, without telling any one there \n",
      "anything that was not known already. But he \n",
      "was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear \n",
      "it any longer. At may never return he began to \n",
      "feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it \n",
      "burst out like the whistle of an engine coming \n",
      "out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up, \n",
      "knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue \n",
      "light on the end of his magic staff, and in its \n",
      "firework glare the poor little hobbit could be \n",
      "seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a \n",
      "jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the \n",
      "floor, and kept on calling out “struck by lightning, \n",
      "struck by lightning!” over and over again; and \n",
      "that was all they could get out of him for a long \n",
      "time. So they took him and laid him out of the \n",
      "way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at \n",
      "his elbow, and they went back to their dark \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "business. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Excitable little fellow,” said Gandalf, as they \n",
      "sat down again. “Gets funny queer fits, but he is \n",
      "one of the best, one of the best — as fierce as a \n",
      "dragon in a pinch.” \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, \n",
      "you will realize that this was only poetical \n",
      "exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old \n",
      "Took’s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was \n",
      "so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a \n",
      "horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of \n",
      "Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, \n",
      "and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean \n",
      "off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards \n",
      "through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, \n",
      "and in this way the battle was won and the \n",
      "game of Golf invented at the same moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer’s \n",
      "gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing- \n",
      "room. After a while and a drink he crept \n",
      "nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what \n",
      "he heard, Gloin speaking: “Humph!” (or some \n",
      "snort more or less like that). “Will he do, do you \n",
      "think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about \n",
      "this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that \n",
      "in a moment of excitement would be enough to \n",
      "wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill \n",
      "the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks \n",
      "more like a grocer than a burglar!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and \n",
      "went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly \n",
      "felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be \n",
      "thought fierce. As for little fellowbobbing on the \n",
      "mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a \n",
      "time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what \n",
      "he did now, and he said to himself: “Bilbo, you \n",

      "dignity) “that you think I am no good. I will show \n",
      "you. I have no signs on my door — it was painted \n",
      "a week ago — , and I am quite sure you have \n",
      "come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw \n",
      "your funny faces on the door-step, I had my \n",

      "say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar \n",
      "if you like. Some of them do. It’s all the same to \n",

      "But we none of us liked the idea of the Front \n",

      "great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out \n",

      "one another in distant lands, and in this \n",
      "neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply \n",
      "not to be found. Swords in these parts are \n",
      "mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and \n",
      "shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons \n",
      "are comfortably far-off (and therefore \n",
      "legendary). That is why I settled on burglary— \n",
      "especially when I remembered the existence of \n",
      "a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo \n",

      "things,” said he, feeling all confused and a bit \n",
      "shaky inside, but so far still Tookishly \n",
      "determined to go on with things. “I mean about \n",
      "the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it \n",
      "got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and \n",
      "further.” \n",

      "hours?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“All the same, I should like it all plain and \n",

      "his best to appear wise and prudent and \n",
      "professional and live up to Gandalfs \n",
      "recommendation. “Also I should like to know \n",
      "about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time \n",
      "required and remuneration, and so forth” — by \n",

      "out of the far North, and came back with all their \n",
      "wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the \n",
      "map. It had been discovered by my far \n",
      "ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined \n",
      "and they tunnelled and they made huger halls \n",
      "and greater workshops — and in addition I \n",
      "believe they found a good deal of gold and a \n",
      "great many jewels too. Anyway they grew \n",
      "immensely rich and famous, and my \n",
      "grandfather was King under the Mountain \n",
      "again, and treated with great reverence by the \n",
      "mortal men, who lived to the South, and were \n",
      "gradually spreading up the Running River as far \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. \n",
      "They built the merry town of Dale there in those \n",
      "days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and \n",
      "reward even the least skillful most richly. \n",
      "Fathers would beg us to take their sons as \n",
      "apprentices, and pay us handsomely, \n",
      "especially in food-supplies, which we never \n",
      "bothered to grow or find for ourselves. \n",
      "Altogether those were good days for us, and \n",
      "the poorest of us had money to spend and to \n",
      "lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just \n",
      "for the fun of it, not to speak of the most \n",
      "marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is \n",
      "not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my \n",
      "grandfather’s halls became full of armour and \n",
      "jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy \n",
      "market of Dale was the wonder of the North. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly that was what brought the \n",

      "their plunder as long as they live (which is \n",
      "practically for ever, unless they are killed), and \n",
      "never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly \n",

      "and destruction that dragons make going from \n",
      "bad to worse. There was a most specially \n",
      "greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. \n",
      "One day he flew up into the air and came south. \n",
      "The first we heard of it was a noise like a \n",
      "hurricane coming from the North, and the pine- \n",
      "trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in \n",
      "the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened \n",

      "adventurous lad in those days, always \n",
      "wandering about, and it saved my life that day) \n",
      "— well, from a good way off we saw the dragon \n",
      "settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then \n",
      "he came down the slopes and when he reached \n",
      "the woods they all went up in fire. By that time \n",
      "all the bells were ringing in Dale and the \n",
      "warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out \n",
      "of their great gate; but there was the dragon \n",
      "waiting for them. None escaped that way. The \n",
      "river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, \n",
      "and in the fog the dragon came on them and \n",
      "destroyed most of the warriors — the usual \n",
      "unhappy story, it was only too common in those \n",
      "days. Then he went back and crept in through \n",
      "the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and \n",
      "lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "himself. Probably, for that is the dragons’ way, \n",
      "he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, \n",
      "and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to \n",
      "crawl out of the great gate and come by night to \n",
      "Dale, and carry away people, especially \n",

      "asked how they had got away, they told me to \n",
      "hold my tongue, and said that one day in the \n",

      "“Up you two get, and off we go!” said \n",
      "Thorin. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "come without my hat, and I have left my pocket- \n",
      "handkerchief behind, and I haven't got any \n",
      "money. I didn't get your note until after 10.45 to \n",
      "be precise.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't be precise,” said Dwalin, “and don't \n",
      "worry! You will have to manage without pocket- \n",
      "handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, \n",
      "before you get to the journey’s end. As for a hat, \n",

      "\n",
      "That's how they all came to start, jogging off \n",
      "from the inn one fine morning just before May, \n",
      "on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark- \n",
      "green hood (a little weather-stained) and a \n",
      "dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They \n",
      "were too large for him, and he looked rather \n",
      "comic. What his father Bungo would have \n",
      "thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort \n",
      "was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he \n",
      "had no beard. \n",
      "\n",
      "They had not been riding very long, when up \n",
      "came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. \n",
      "He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, \n",
      "and Bilbo's pipe and tobacco. So after that the \n",
      "party went along very merrily, and they told \n",
      "stories or sang songs as they rode forward all \n",
      "day, except of course when they stopped for \n",
      "meals. These didn't come quite as often as \n",
      "Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began \n",
      "to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first they had passed through hobbit- \n",
      "lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by \n",
      "decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and \n",
      "now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on \n",
      "business. Then they came to lands where \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo \n",
      "had never heard before. Now they had gone on \n",
      "far into the Lone-lands, where there were no \n",
      "people left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily \n",
      "worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising \n",
      "higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of \n",
      "them were old castles with an evil look, as if \n",
      "they had been built by wicked people. \n",
      "Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that \n",
      "day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been \n",
      "as good as May can be, can be, even in merry \n",
      "tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone- \n",
      "lands they had been obliged to camp when they \n",
      "could, but at least it had been dry. \n",
      "\n",
      "“To think it will soon be June!” grumbled \n",
      "Bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others \n",
      "in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it \n",
      "was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his \n",
      "hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was \n",
      "full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on \n",
      "stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. “And \n",
      "I'm sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and \n",
      "into the food-bags,” thought Bilbo. “Bother \n",
      "burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was \n",
      "at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the \n",
      "kettle just beginning to sing!” It was not the last \n",
      "time that he wished that! \n",
      "\n",
      "Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning \n",
      "round or taking any notice of the hobbit. \n",
      "Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun \n",
      "must have gone down, for it began to get dark \n",
      "as they went down into a deep valley with a river \n",
      "at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along \n",
      "its banks bent and sighed. Fortunately the road \n",
      "went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "swollen with the rains, came rushing down from \n",
      "the hills and mountains in the north. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was nearly night when they had crossed \n",
      "over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a \n",
      "wandering moon appeared above the hills \n",
      "between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and \n",
      "Thorin muttered something about supper, “and \n",
      "where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?” \n",
      "\n",
      "Not until then did they notice that Gandalf \n",
      "was missing. So far he had come all the way \n",
      "with them, never saying if he was in the \n",
      "adventure or merely keeping them company for \n",
      "a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and \n",
      "laughed most. But now he simply was not there \n",
      "at all! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just when a wizard would have been most \n",
      "useful, too,” groaned Dori and Nori (who shared \n",
      "the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty \n",
      "and often). \n",
      "\n",
      "They decided in the end that they would \n",
      "have to camp where they were. They moved to \n",
      "a clump of trees, and though it was drier under \n",
      "them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, \n",
      "and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the \n",
      "mischief seemed to have got into the fire. \n",
      "Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out \n",
      "of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they \n",
      "could not do it that night, not even Oin and \n",
      "Gloin, who were specially good at it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing \n",
      "and bolted. He got into the river before they \n",
      "could catch him; and before they could get him \n",
      "out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and all the baggage that he carried was \n",
      "washed away off him. Of course it was mostly \n",
      "food, and there was mighty little left for supper, \n",
      "and less for breakfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they all sat glum and wet and \n",
      "muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to \n",
      "light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was \n",
      "sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony- \n",
      "rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was \n",
      "always their look-out man, said: “There's a light \n",
      "over there!” There was a hill some way off with \n",
      "trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark \n",
      "mass of the trees they could now see a light \n",
      "shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as \n",
      "it might be a fire or torches twinkling. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they had looked at it for some while, \n",
      "they fell to arguing. Some said “no” and some \n",
      "said “yes”. Some said they could but go and \n",
      "see, and anything was better than little supper, \n",
      "less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Others said: “These parts are none too well \n",
      "known, and are too near the mountains. \n",
      "Travellers seldom come this way now. The old \n",
      "maps are no use: things have changed for the \n",
      "worse and the road is unguarded. They have \n",
      "seldom even heard of the king round here, and \n",
      "the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the \n",
      "less trouble you are likely to find.” Some said: \n",
      "“After all there are fourteen of us.” Others said: \n",
      "“Where has Gandalf got to?” This remark was \n",
      "repeated by everybody. Then the rain began to \n",
      "pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin \n",
      "began to fight. \n",
      "\n",
      "That settled it. “After all we have got a \n",
      "burglar with us,” they said; and so they made \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper \n",
      "caution) in the direction of the light. They came \n",
      "to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the hill \n",
      "they went; but there was no proper path to be \n",
      "seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm; \n",
      "and do what they could they made a deal of \n",
      "rustling and crackling and creaking (and a good \n",
      "deal of grumbling and drafting), as they went \n",
      "through the trees in the pitch dark. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the red light shone out very bright \n",
      "through the tree-trunks not far ahead. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now it is the burglar’s turn,” they said, \n",
      "meaning Bilbo. “You must go on and find out all \n",
      "about that light, and what it is for, and if all is \n",
      "perfectly safe and canny,” said Thorin to the \n",
      "hobbit. “Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if \n",
      "all is well. If not, come back if you can! If you \n",

      "screech-owl, and we will do what we can.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain \n",
      "that he could not hoot even once like any kind of \n",
      "owl any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate \n",
      "hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely \n",
      "quietly. They take a pride in it, and Bilbo had \n",
      "sniffed more than once at what he called “all this \n",
      "dwarvish racket,” as they went along, though I \n",
      "don’t suppose you or I would have noticed \n",
      "anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole \n",
      "cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Bilbo \n",
      "walking primly towards the red light, I don't \n",
      "suppose even a weasel would have stirred a \n",
      "whisker at it. So, naturally, he got right up to the \n",
      "fire — for fire it was — without disturbing anyone. \n",
      "And this is what he saw. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three very large persons sitting round a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "very large fire of beech-logs. They were \n",
      "toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and \n",
      "licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a \n",
      "fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of \n",
      "good drink at hand, and they were drinking out \n",
      "of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls. \n",
      "Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could \n",
      "see that: from the great heavy faces of them, \n",
      "and theirsize, and the shape oftheirlegs, not to \n",
      "mention their language, which was not drawing- \n",
      "room fashion at all, at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and \n",
      "blimey, if it don't look like mutton again \n",
      "tomorrer,” said one of the trolls. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we \n",
      "had for long enough,” said a second. “What the \n",
      "'ell William was a-thinkin' of to bring us into \n",
      "these parts at all, beats me — and the drink \n",
      "runnin' short, what's more,” he said jogging the \n",
      "elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his \n",
      "\n",
      "jug. \n",
      "\n",
      "William choked. “Shut yer mouth!” he said \n",
      "as soon as he could. “Yer can't expect folk to \n",
      "stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert. \n",
      "You've et a village and a half between yer, since \n",
      "we come down from the mountains. How much \n",
      "more d'yer want? And time's been up our way \n",
      "when yer'd have said ‘thank yer Bill’ for a nice \n",
      "bit o’ fat valley mutton like what this is.” He took \n",
      "a big bite off a sheep's leg he was roasting, \n",
      "and wiped his lips on his sleeve. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, \n",
      "even those with only one head each. After \n",
      "hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done \n",
      "something at once. Either he should have gone \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "back quietly and warned his friends that there \n",
      "were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty \n",
      "mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even \n",
      "pony, for a change; or else he should have done \n",
      "a bit of good quick burgling. A really first-class \n",
      "and legendary burglar would at this point have \n",
      "picked the trolls’ pockets — it is nearly always \n",
      "worth while, if you can manage it — , pinched the \n",
      "very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and \n",
      "walked off without their noticing him. Others \n",
      "more practical but with less professional pride \n",
      "would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each \n",
      "of them before they observed it. Then the night \n",
      "could have been spent cheerily. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many \n",
      "things he had never seen or done. He was very \n",
      "much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished \n",
      "himself a hundred miles away, and yet — and yet \n",
      "somehow he could not go straight back to \n",
      "Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So he \n",
      "stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the \n",
      "various burglarious proceedings he had heard \n",
      "of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least \n",
      "difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just \n",
      "behind William. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William \n",
      "was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked \n",
      "up courage and put his little hand in William's \n",
      "enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as \n",
      "big as a bag to Bilbo. “Ha!” thought he, \n",
      "warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully \n",
      "out, “this is a beginning!” \n",
      "\n",
      "It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and \n",
      "this was no exception. “’Ere, 'oo are you?” it \n",
      "squeaked, as it left the pocket; and William \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the \n",
      "neck, before he could duck behind the tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Blimey, Bert, look what I’ve copped!” said \n",
      "William. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” said the others coming up. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Bilbo Baggins, a bur — a hobbit,” said poor \n",
      "Bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to \n",
      "make owl-noises before they throttled him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“A burrahobbit?” said they a bit startled. \n",
      "Trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty \n",
      "suspicious about anything new to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What's a burrahobbit got to do with my \n",
      "pocket, anyways?” said William. \n",
      "\n",
      "“And can yer cook 'em?” said Tom. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Yer can try,\" said Bert, picking up a \n",
      "skewer. \n",
      "\n",
      "“He wouldn't make above a mouthful,” said \n",
      "William, who had already had a fine supper, \n",
      "“not when he was skinned and boned.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“P'raps there are more like him round \n",
      "about, and we might make a pie,” said Bert. \n",
      "“Here you, are there any more of your sort a- \n",
      "sneakin' in these here woods, yer nassty little \n",
      "rabbit,” said he looking at the hobbit's furry feet; \n",
      "and he picked him up by the toes and shook \n",
      "him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, lots,” said Bilbo, before he \n",
      "remembered not to give his friends away. “No \n",
      "none at all, not one,” he said immediately \n",
      "afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What d'yer mean?” said Bert, holding him \n",
      "right way up, bythe hairthis time. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What I say,” said Bilbo gasping. “And \n",
      "please don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a good \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you \n",
      "see what I mean. I’ll cook beautifully for you, a \n",
      "perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you \n",
      "won't have me for supper.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor little blighter,” said William. He had \n",
      "already had as much supper as he could hold; \n",
      "also he had had lots of beer. “Poor little \n",
      "blighter! Let him go!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Not till he says what he means by lots and \n",
      "none at all,\" said Bert. “I don't want to have me \n",
      "throat cut in me sleep! Hold his toes in the fire, \n",
      "till he talks!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t have it,” said William. “I caught him \n",
      "anyway.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“You're a fat fool, William,” said Bert, “as \n",
      "I've said afore this evening.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“And you're a lout!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“And I won't take that from you, Bill \n",
      "Huggins,” says Bert, and puts his fist in \n",
      "William's eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had \n",
      "just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on \n",
      "the ground, to scramble out of the way of their \n",
      "feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and \n",
      "calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and \n",
      "applicable names in very loud voices. Soon \n",
      "they were locked in one another’s arms, and \n",
      "rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, \n",
      "while Tom whacked at them both with a branch \n",
      "to bring them to their senses — and that of \n",
      "course only made them madder than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "That would have been the time for Bilbo to \n",
      "have left. But his poor little feet had been very \n",
      "squashed in Bert's big paw, and he had no \n",
      "breath in his body, and his head was going \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "round; so there he lay for a while panting, just \n",
      "outside the circle of firelight. \n",
      "\n",
      "Right in the middle of the fight up came \n",
      "Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a \n",
      "distance, and after waiting for some time for \n",
      "Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they \n",
      "started off one by one to creep towards the light \n",
      "as quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom \n",
      "see Balin come into the light than he gave an \n",
      "awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of \n",
      "dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill stopped \n",
      "fighting immediately, and “a sack, Tom, quick!” \n",
      "they said. Before Balin, who was wondering \n",
      "where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew \n",
      "what was happening, a sack was over his head, \n",
      "and he was down. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There's more to come yet,” said Tom, “or \n",
      "I'm mighty mistook. Lots and none at all, it is,” \n",
      "said he. “No burrahobbits, but lots of these here \n",
      "dwarves. That's about the shape of it!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you’re right,” said Bert, “and we’d \n",

      "And so they did. With sacks in their hands, \n",
      "that they used for carrying off mutton and other \n",
      "plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each \n",
      "dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the \n",
      "spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in \n",
      "surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his \n",
      "head, and he was down. Soon Dwalin lay by \n",
      "Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and \n",
      "Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin \n",
      "and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled \n",
      "uncomfortably near the fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That’ll teach 'em,” said Tom; for Bifur and \n",

      "unawares. He came expecting mischief, and \n",
      "didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out \n",
      "of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. \n",
      "He stood outside in the shadows some way off, \n",
      "and said: “What's all this trouble? Who has \n",
      "been knocking my people about?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“It's trolls!” said Bilbo from behind a tree. \n",

      "\n",
      "“O! are they?” said Thorin, and he jumped \n",
      "forward to the fire, before they could leap on \n",
      "him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one \n",
      "end: and Bert got that end in his eye before he \n",
      "could step aside. That put him out of the battle \n",
      "for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of \n",
      "Tom’s leg — as well as he could, it was thick as \n",
      "a young tree-trunk — but he was sent spinning \n",
      "up into the top of some bushes, when Tom \n",

      "lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I \n",
      "can tell you. But just at that moment William \n",
      "came up behind and popped a sack right over \n",
      "Thorin's head and down to his toes. And so the \n",
      "fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: \n",
      "all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls \n",
      "(and two with burns and bashes to remember) \n",
      "sitting by them, arguing whether they should \n",
      "roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil \n",
      "them, or just sit on them one by one and squash \n",
      "them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his \n",

      "“Excellent!” said Gandalf, as he stepped \n",
      "from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb \n",
      "down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo \n",
      "understood. It was the wizard's voice that had \n",

      "light came and made an end of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to untie the sacks and let \n",
      "out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated, \n",

      "lying there listening to the trolls making plans for \n",
      "roasting them and squashing them and mincing \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They searched about, and soon found the \n",
      "marks of trolls' stony boots going away through \n",
      "the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill, \n",
      "until hidden by bushes they came on a big door \n",
      "of stone leading to a cave. But they could not \n",
      "open it, not though they all pushed while \n",
      "Gandalf tried various incantations. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo, \n",
      "when they were getting tired and angry. “I found \n",
      "it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.” \n",
      "He held out a largish key, though no doubt \n",
      "William had thought it very small and secret. It \n",

      "before he was turned to stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why on earth didn't you mention it before?” \n",
      "they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into \n",
      "the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back \n",
      "with one big push, and they all went inside. \n",
      "There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell \n",
      "was in the air; but there was a good deal of \n",
      "food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the \n",
      "ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all \n",
      "sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold \n",
      "coins standing in a corner. There were lots of \n",
      "clothes, too, hanging on the walls — too small for \n",
      "trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims — and \n",
      "among them were several swords of various \n",
      "makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their \n",
      "eyes particularly, because of their beautiful \n",
      "scabbards and jewelled hilts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It \n",
      "would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a \n",
      "troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the \n",
      "hobbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "“These look like good blades,” said the \n",
      "wizard, half drawing them and looking at them \n",
      "curiously. “They were not made by any troll, nor \n",
      "by any smith among men in these parts and \n",
      "days; but when we can read the runes on them, \n",
      "we shall know more about them.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's get out of this horrible smell!” said \n",
      "Fili. So they carried out the pots of coins, and \n",
      "such food as was untouched and looked fit to \n",
      "eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By \n",
      "that time they felt like breakfast, and being very \n",
      "hungry they did not turn their noses up at what \n",
      "they had got from the trolls’ larder. Their own \n",
      "provisions were very scanty. Now they had \n",
      "bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon \n",
      "to toast in the embers of the fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that they slept, for their night had been \n",
      "disturbed; and they did nothing more till the \n",
      "afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, \n",
      "and carried away the pots of gold, and buried \n",
      "them very secretly not far from the track by the \n",
      "river, putting a great many spells over them, just \n",
      "in case they ever had the chance to come back \n",
      "and recover them. When that was done, they all \n",
      "mounted once more, and jogged along again \n",
      "on the path towards the East. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where did you go to, if I may ask?” said \n",

      "more plain?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I went on to spy out our road. It will soon \n",
      "become dangerous and difficult. Also I was \n",
      "anxious about replenishing our small stock of \n",

      "out all about it. As I was saying I met two of \n",
      "Elrond's people. They were hurrying along for \n",
      "fear of the trolls. It was they who told me that \n",
      "three of them had come down from the \n",
      "mountains and settled in the woods not far from \n",
      "the road: they had frightened everyone away \n",
      "from the district, and they waylaid strangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I immediately had a feeling that I was \n",
      "wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the \n",
      "distance and made for it. So now you know. \n",
      "Please be more careful, next time, or we shall \n",

      "They did not sing or tell stories that day, even \n",
      "though the weather improved; nor the next day, \n",
      "nor the day after. They had begun to feel that \n",
      "danger was not far away on either side. They \n",
      "camped under the stars, and their horses had \n",
      "more to eat than they had; for there was plenty \n",
      "of grass, but there was not much in their bags, \n",
      "even with what they had got from the trolls. One \n",
      "morning they forded a river at a wide shallow \n",
      "place full of the noise of stones and foam. The \n",
      "far bank was steep and slippery. When they got \n",
      "to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw \n",
      "that the great mountains had marched down \n",
      "very near to them. Already they seemed only a \n",
      "day’s easy journey from the feet of the nearest. \n",

      "“Is that The Mountain?” asked Bilbo in a \n",

      "before. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not!” said Balin. “That is only the \n",

      "somehow, before we can come into Wilderland \n",

      "East where Smaug lies on our treasure.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“O!” said Bilbo, and just at that moment he \n",
      "felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling \n",
      "before. He was thinking once again of his \n",
      "comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite \n",
      "sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle \n",
      "singing. Not for the last time! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss \n",
      "the road, or we shall be done for,” he said. “We \n",
      "need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable \n",
      "safety — also it is very necessary to tackle the \n",
      "Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you \n",
      "will get lost in them, and have to come back and \n",
      "start at the beginning again (if you ever get \n",
      "back at all).” \n",

      "They asked him where he was making for, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair \n",
      "valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last \n",
      "Homely House. I sent a message by my friends, \n",
      "and we are expected.” \n",
      "\n",
      "That sounded nice and comforting, but they \n",
      "had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as \n",
      "it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of \n",
      "the Mountains. There seemed to be no trees \n",
      "and no valleys and no hills to break the ground \n",
      "in front of them, only one vast slope going slowly \n",
      "up and up to meet the feet of the nearest \n",
      "mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and \n",
      "crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of \n",

      "\n",
      "Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all \n",

      "dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they \n",
      "saw now that the house might be hidden almost \n",
      "anywhere between them and the mountains. \n",
      "They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with \n",
      "steep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, \n",
      "and they looked down surprised to see trees \n",
      "below them and running water at the bottom. \n",
      "There were gullies that they could almost leap \n",
      "over, but very deep with waterfalls in them. \n",
      "There were dark ravines that one could neither \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "jump over nor climb into. There were bogs, \n",
      "some of them green pleasant places to look at, \n",
      "with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony \n",
      "that walked there with a pack on its back would \n",

      "\n",
      "It was indeed a much wider land from the \n",
      "ford to the mountains than ever you would have \n",
      "guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path \n",
      "was marked with white stones, some of which \n",
      "were small, and others were half covered with \n",
      "moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow \n",
      "business following the track, even guided by \n",
      "Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about \n",
      "pretty well. \n",
      "\n",

      "the end of the search when the day began to \n",
      "fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed \n",
      "supper-time would soon do the same. There \n",
      "were moths fluttering about, and the light \n",
      "became very dim, for the moon had not risen. \n",
      "Bilbo’s pony began to stumble over roots and \n",
      "stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in \n",
      "the ground so suddenly that Gandalfs horse \n",
      "nearly slipped down the slope. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Here it is at last!” he called, and the others \n",
      "gathered round him and looked over the edge. \n",

      "the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every \n",
      "now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or \n",
      "bumped his nose on the pony’s neck. Their \n",
      "spirits rose as they went down and down. The \n",

      "\n",
      "O! What are you doing, \n",
      "\n",
      "And where are you going? \n",

      "The river is flowing! \n",
      "\n",
      "O! tra-la-la-lally \n",
      "here down in the valley! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "O! What are you seeking, \n",
      "And where are you making? \n",
      "The faggots are reeking, \n",
      "\n",
      "The bannocks are baking! \n",
      "0! tril-lil-lil-lolly \n",
      "the valley is jolly, \n",
      "ha! ha! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "0! Where are you going \n",
      "With beards all a-wagging? \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So they laughed and sang in the trees; and \n",
      "pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not \n",
      "that they would care; they would only laugh all \n",
      "the more if you told them so. They were elves of \n",
      "course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as \n",
      "the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though \n",
      "he seldom met them; but he was a little \n",
      "frightened of them too. Dwarves don’t get on \n",
      "well with them. Even decent enough dwarves \n",
      "like Thorin and his friends think them foolish \n",
      "(which is a very foolish thing to think), or get \n",
      "annoyed with them. For some elves tease them \n",

      "“Most astonishing wonderful!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then off they went into another song as \n",
      "ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. \n",
      "At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from \n",
      "the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Welcome to the valley!” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but \n",
      "Gandalf was already off his horse and among \n",
      "the elves, talking merrily with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a little out of your way,” said the elf: \n",
      "“that is, if you are making for the only path \n",
      "across the water and to the house beyond. We \n",
      "will set you right, but you had best get on foot, \n",
      "until you are over the bridge. Are you going to \n",
      "stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight \n",
      "on? Supper is preparing over there,” he said. “I \n",
      "can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to \n",
      "stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing to \n",
      "miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for \n",
      "such things. Also he would have liked to have a \n",
      "few private words with these people that \n",
      "seemed to know his names and all about him, \n",
      "although he had never seen them before. He \n",
      "thought their opinion of his adventure might be \n",
      "interesting. Elves know a lot and are wondrous \n",
      "folk for news, and know what is going on among \n",
      "the peoples of the land, as quick as water flows, \n",
      "or quicker. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the dwarves were all for supper as soon \n",
      "as possible just then, and would not stay. On \n",
      "they all went, leading their ponies, till they were \n",
      "brought to a good path and so at last to the very \n",
      "brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as mountain-streams do of a summer evening, \n",
      "when sun has been all day on the snow far up \n",
      "above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone \n",
      "without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could \n",
      "well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow \n",
      "and careful, one by one, each leading his pony \n",
      "by the bridle. The elves had brought bright \n",
      "lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry \n",
      "song as the party went across. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!” \n",
      "they cried to Thorin, who was bent almost on to \n",

      "watering it.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” they \n",

      "\n",
      "“Hush, hush! Good People! and good \n",

      "have ears, and some elves have over merry \n",
      "tongues. Good night!” \n",
      "\n",
      "And so at last they all came to the Last \n",

      "\n",
      "Now it is a strange thing, but things that are \n",
      "good to have and days that are good to spend \n",
      "are soon told about, and not much to listen to; \n",
      "while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and even gruesome, may make a good tale, \n",
      "and take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed \n",
      "long in that good house, fourteen days at least, \n",
      "and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would \n",
      "gladly have stopped there for ever and ever — \n",
      "even supposing a wish would have taken him \n",
      "right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet \n",
      "there is little to tell about their stay. \n",

      "days of our tale there were still some people \n",
      "who had both elves and heroes of the North for \n",
      "ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house \n",
      "was their chief. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was as noble and as fair in face as an \n",
      "elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a \n",
      "wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and \n",
      "as kind as summer. He comes into many tales, \n",
      "but his part in the story of Bilbo’s great \n",
      "adventure is only a small one, though important, \n",
      "as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. \n",
      "His house was perfect, whether you liked food, \n",
      "or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, or \n",
      "just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant \n",
      "mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into \n",
      "that valley. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the \n",
      "tales or one or two of the songs that they heard \n",
      "in that house. All of them, the ponies as well, \n",
      "grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. \n",
      "Their clothes were mended as well as their \n",
      "bruises, their tempers and their hopes. Their \n",
      "bags were filled with food and provisions light \n",
      "to carry but strong to bring them over the \n",
      "mountain passes. Their plans were improved \n",
      "with the best advice. So the time came to \n",
      "midsummer eve, and they were to go on again \n",
      "with the early sun on midsummer morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. \n",
      "That day he looked at the swords they had \n",
      "brought from the trolls’ lair, and he said: “These \n",
      "are not troll-make. They are old swords, very old \n",
      "swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin. \n",
      "They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin- \n",
      "wars. They must have come from a dragon’s \n",
      "hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and \n",
      "goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. \n",
      "This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin- \n",
      "cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was \n",
      "a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, \n",
      "Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once \n",
      "wore. Keep them well!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Whence did the trolls get them, I wonder?” \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could not say,” said Elrond, “but one may \n",
      "guess that your trolls had plundered other \n",
      "plunderers, or come on the remnants of old \n",
      "robberies in some hold in the mountains. I have \n",
      "heard that there are still forgotten treasures of \n",
      "old to be found in the deserted caverns of the \n",
      "mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin \n",
      "war.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Thorin pondered these words. “I will keep \n",
      "this sword in honour,” he said. “May it soon \n",
      "cleave goblins once again!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“A wish that is likely to be granted soon \n",
      "enough in the mountains!” said Elrond. “But \n",
      "show me now your map!” \n",
      "\n",
      "He took it and gazed long at it, and he \n",
      "shook his head; for if he did not altogether \n",
      "approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he \n",
      "hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and \n",
      "he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of \n",
      "Dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks \n",
      "of the bright River Running. The moon was \n",
      "shining in a broad silver crescent. He held up \n",
      "the map and the white light shone through it. \n",
      "“What is this?” he said. “There are moon-letters \n",
      "here, beside the plain runes which say ‘five feet \n",
      "high the door and three may walk abreast.’” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What are moon-letters?” asked the hobbit \n",
      "full of excitement. He loved maps, as I have told \n",
      "you before; and he also liked runes and letters \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote \n",
      "himself it was a bit thin and spidery. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you \n",
      "cannot see them,” said Elrond, “not when you \n",
      "look straight at them. They can only be seen \n",
      "when the moon shines behind them, and what is \n",
      "more, with the more cunning sort it must be a \n",
      "moon of the same shape and season as the \n",
      "day when they were written. The dwarves \n",
      "invented them and wrote them with silver pens, \n",
      "as your friends could tell you. These must have \n",
      "been written on a midsummer’s eve in a \n",
      "crescent moon, a long while ago.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What do they say?” asked Gandalf and \n",
      "Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even \n",
      "Elrond should have found this out first, though \n",
      "really there had not been a chance before, and \n",
      "there would not have been another until \n",

      "\n",
      "“Stand by the grey stone when the thrush \n",

      "\n",

      "Winter. We still call it Durin’s Day when the last \n",
      "moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "down into the darkness where they smashed \n",
      "among the trees far below, or splintered into \n",
      "little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a \n",
      "rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail \n",
      "about in every direction, so that an overhanging \n",
      "rock was no protection at all. Soon they were \n",
      "getting drenched and their ponies were \n",
      "standing with their heads down and their tails \n",
      "between their legs, and some of them were \n",
      "whinnying with fright. They could hear the giants \n",
      "guffawing and shouting all over the \n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, if you know of anywhere better, take \n",
      "us there!” said Gandalf, who was feeling very \n",
      "grumpy, and was far from happy about the \n",
      "giants himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "The end of their argument was that they \n",
      "sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. \n",
      "They had very sharp eyes, and being the \n",
      "youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years \n",
      "they usually got these sort of jobs (when \n",

      "looking, if you want to find something (or so \n",
      "Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly \n",
      "usually find something, if you look, but it is not \n",
      "always quite the something you were after. So it \n",
      "proved on this occasion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, \n",
      "holding on to the rocks in the wind. “We have \n",
      "found a dry cave,” they said, “not far round the \n",
      "next corner; and ponies and all could get \n",
      "inside.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Flave you thoroughly explored it?” said the \n",
      "wizard, who knew that caves up in the \n",
      "mountains were seldom unoccupied. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes!” they said, though everybody \n",
      "knew they could not have been long about it; \n",
      "they had come back too quick. “It isn't all that \n",
      "big, and it does not go far back.” \n",
      "\n",
      "That, of course, is the dangerous part about \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "caves: you don’t know how far they go back, \n",
      "sometimes, or where a passage behind may \n",
      "lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But \n",
      "now Fili and Kili’s news seemed good enough. \n",
      "So they all got up and prepared to move. The \n",
      "wind was howling and the thunder still growling, \n",
      "and they had a business getting themselves \n",
      "and their ponies along. Still it was not very far to \n",
      "go, and before long they came to a big rock \n",
      "standing out into the path. If you stepped \n",
      "behind, you found a low arch in the side of the \n",
      "mountain. There was just room to get the \n",
      "ponies through with a squeeze, when they had \n",
      "been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed \n",
      "under the arch, it was good to hear the wind \n",
      "and the rain outside instead of all about them, \n",
      "and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. \n",
      "But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his \n",
      "wand — as he did that day in Bilbo’s dining- \n",
      "room that seemed so long ago, if you \n",
      "remember — , and by its light they explored the \n",
      "cave from end to end. \n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large \n",
      "and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some \n",
      "comfortable nooks. At one end there was room \n",
      "for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty \n",
      "glad of the change) steaming, and champing in \n",
      "their nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a \n",
      "fire at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf \n",
      "would not hear of it. So they spread out their \n",
      "wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of \n",
      "their bundles; then they made their blankets \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "comfortable, got out their pipes and blew \n",
      "smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different \n",
      "colours and set dancing up by the roof to \n",
      "amuse them. They talked and talked, and forgot \n",
      "about the storm, and discussed what each \n",
      "would do with his share of the treasure (when \n",
      "they got it, which at the moment did not seem \n",
      "so impossible); and so they dropped off to \n",
      "sleep one by one. And that was the last time \n",
      "that they used the ponies, packages, \n",
      "baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they \n",
      "had brought with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out a good thing that night that they \n",
      "had brought little Bilbo with them, after all. For, \n",
      "somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long \n",
      "while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty \n",
      "dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at \n",
      "the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and \n",
      "opened wider and wider, and he was very \n",
      "afraid but could not call out or do anything but \n",
      "lie and look. Then he dreamed that the floor of \n",
      "the cave was giving way, and he was slipping — \n",
      "beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows \n",
      "where to. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that he woke up with a horrible start, and \n",
      "found that part of his dream was true. A crack \n",
      "had opened at the back of the cave, and was \n",
      "already a wide passage. He was just in time to \n",
      "see the last of the ponies’ tails disappearing \n",
      "into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as \n",
      "loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is \n",
      "surprising for their size. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great \n",
      "ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you \n",
      "could say rocks and blocks. There were six to \n",
      "each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; \n",
      "and they were all grabbed and carried through \n",
      "the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. \n",
      "But not Gandalf. Bilbo’s yell had done that much \n",
      "good. It had wakened him up wide in a \n",
      "splintered second, and when goblins came to \n",
      "grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning \n",
      "in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several \n",
      "of them fell dead. \n",
      "\n",
      "The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo \n",
      "and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! \n",
      "Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the \n",
      "goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not \n",
      "wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the \n",
      "dwarves and hurried them along. It was deep, \n",
      "deep, dark, such as only goblins that have \n",
      "taken to living in the heart of the mountains can \n",
      "see through. The passages there were crossed \n",
      "and tangled in all directions, but the goblins \n",
      "knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest \n",
      "post-office; and the way went down and down, \n",
      "and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were \n",
      "very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and \n",
      "chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony \n",
      "voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than \n",
      "when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He \n",
      "wished again and again for his nice bright \n",
      "hobbit-hole. Not for the last time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now there came a glimmer of a red light \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "before them. The goblins began to sing, or \n",
      "croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet \n",
      "on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as \n",
      "well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Clap! Snap! the black crack! \n",
      "Grip, grab! Pinch, nab! \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "general meaning of the song was only too plain; \n",
      "for now the goblins took out whips and whipped \n",
      "them with a s\\nish, smack!, and set them \n",
      "running as fast as they could in front of them; \n",
      "and more than one of the dwarves were already \n",
      "yammering and bleating like anything, when \n",
      "they stumbled into a big cavern. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, \n",
      "and by torches along the walls, and it was full of \n",
      "goblins. They all laughed and stamped and \n",
      "clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with \n",
      "poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the \n",
      "whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers \n",
      "whooped and cracked their whips behind. The \n",
      "ponies were already there huddled in a corner; \n",
      "and there were all the baggages and packages \n",
      "lying broken open, and being rummaged by \n",
      "goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by \n",
      "goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid that was the last they ever saw \n",
      "of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly \n",
      "sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to \n",
      "Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the \n",
      "mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses and \n",
      "ponies and donkeys (and other much more \n",
      "dreadful things), and they are always hungry. \n",
      "Just now however the prisoners were thinking \n",
      "only of themselves. The goblins chained their \n",
      "hands behind their backs and linked them all \n",
      "together in a line, and dragged them to the far \n",

      "armed goblins were standing round him \n",
      "carrying the axes and the bent swords that they \n",
      "use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad- \n",
      "hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they \n",

      "mine as well as any but the most skilled \n",
      "dwarves, when they take the trouble, though \n",
      "they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, \n",
      "axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and \n",
      "also instruments of torture, they make very well, \n",
      "or get other people to make to their design, \n",
      "prisoners and slaves that have to work till they \n",
      "die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that \n",

      "explosions always delighted them, and also not \n",
      "working with their own hands more than they \n",
      "could help; but in those days and those wild \n",
      "parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so \n",
      "far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no \n",
      "more than they hated everybody and everything, \n",
      "and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in \n",
      "some parts wicked dwarves had even made \n",
      "alliances with them. But they had a special \n",
      "grudge against Thorin’s people, because of the \n",
      "war which you have heard mentioned, but which \n",
      "does not come into this tale; and anyway \n",

      "as he could trot, at the end of the line, down \n",
      "more dark passages with the yells of the goblin- \n",

      "\n",
      "not seem of any particular use at the moment. \n",
      "He did not go much further, but sat down on the \n",

      "\n",
      "After some time he felt for his pipe. It was \n",

      "felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco \n",
      "in it, and that was something more. Then he felt \n",

      "round himself for matches his hand came on the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "got from the trolls, and that he had quite \n",
      "forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins \n",
      "noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim \n",
      "before his eyes. “So it is an elvish blade, too,” \n",
      "he thought; “and goblins are not very near, and \n",
      "yet not far enough.” \n",
      "\n",

      "“Go back?” he thought. “No good at all! Go \n",

      "in the same direction in spite of a twist and a \n",
      "turn or two. There were passages leading off to \n",
      "the side every now and then, as he knew by the \n",
      "glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand \n",
      "on the wall. Of these he took no notice, except \n",
      "to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined \n",
      "dark things coming out of them. On and on he \n",
      "went, and down and down; and still he heard no \n",
      "sound of anything except the occasional whirr of \n",
      "a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it \n",
      "became too frequent to bother about. I do not \n",
      "know how long he kept on like this, hating to go \n",
      "on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was \n",
      "tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to \n",
      "tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly without any warning he trotted \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That \n",
      "pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know \n",

      "edge of an underground stream that crossed \n",
      "the passage, or the brink of a deep dark \n",
      "subterranean lake. The sword was hardly \n",
      "shining at all. He stopped, and he could hear, \n",
      "when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping \n",
      "from an unseen roof into the water below; but \n",
      "there seemed no other sort of sound. \n",
      "\n",
      "“So it is a pool or a lake, and not an \n",
      "underground river,” he thought. Still he did not \n",
      "dare to wade out into the darkness. He could \n",
      "not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy \n",
      "things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in \n",
      "the water. There are strange things living in the \n",
      "pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish \n",
      "whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows \n",
      "how many years ago, and never swam out \n",
      "again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger \n",

      "made for themselves there are other things \n",
      "living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in \n",
      "from outside to lie up in the dark. Some of \n",
      "these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Deep down here by the dark water lived old \n",
      "Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know \n",
      "where he came from, nor who or what he was. \n",
      "He was Gollum — as dark as darkness, except \n",
      "for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He \n",
      "had a little boat, and he rowed about quite \n",
      "quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and \n",
      "deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large \n",
      "feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple \n",
      "did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his \n",
      "pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he \n",
      "grabbed with his long fingers as quick as \n",
      "thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought \n",
      "good, when he could get it; but he took care \n",
      "they never found him out. He just throttled them \n",
      "from behind, if they ever came down alone \n",
      "anywhere near the edge of the water, while he \n",
      "was prowling about. They very seldom did, for \n",
      "they had a feeling that something unpleasant \n",
      "was lurking down there, down at the very roots \n",
      "of the mountain. They had come on the lake, \n",
      "when they were tunnelling down long ago, and \n",
      "they found they could go no further; so there \n",
      "their road ended in that direction, and there was \n",
      "no reason to go that way — unless the Great \n",
      "Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy \n",
      "for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "goblin nor fish came back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of \n",
      "rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching \n",
      "Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes \n",
      "like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he \n",
      "was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could \n",
      "see that he was no goblin at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum got into his boat and shot off from \n",
      "the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink \n",
      "altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way \n",
      "and his wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and \n",
      "whispered and hissed: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I \n",
      "guess it’s a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel \n",
      "it’d make us, gollum!”And when he said gollum \n",
      "he made a horrible swallowing noise in his \n",
      "throat. That is how he got his name, though he \n",
      "always called himself ‘my precious’. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin \n",
      "when the hiss came in his ears, and he \n",
      "suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you?” he said, thrusting his \n",
      "dagger in front of him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What iss he, my preciouss?” whispered \n",
      "Gollum (who always spoke to himself through \n",
      "never having anyone else to speak to). This is \n",
      "what he had come to find out, for he was not \n",
      "really very hungry at the moment, only curious; \n",
      "otherwise he would have grabbed first and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "whispered afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the \n",
      "dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don’t \n",

      "only I can get away.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s he got in his handses?” said \n",

      "quite like. \n",
      "\n",
      "“A sword, a blade which came out of \n",
      "Gondolin!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Sssss” said Gollum, and became quite \n",
      "polite. “Praps ye sits here and chats with it a \n",
      "bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it \n",
      "does, does it?” He was anxious to appear \n",
      "friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he \n",
      "found out more about the sword and the hobbit, \n",
      "whether he was quite alone really, whether he \n",
      "was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really \n",
      "hungry. Riddles were all he could think of. \n",
      "Asking them, and sometimes guessing them, \n",
      "had been the only game he had ever played \n",
      "with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in \n",
      "the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends \n",
      "and was driven away, alone, and crept down, \n",
      "down, into the dark under the mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well,” said Bilbo, who was anxious to \n",
      "agree, until he found out more about the \n",
      "creature, whether he was quite alone, whether \n",
      "he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "friend of the goblins. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You ask first,” he said, because he had not \n",
      "had time to think of a riddle. \n",
      "\n",
      "So Gollum hissed: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What has roots as nobody sees, \n",
      "Is taller than trees, \n",
      "\n",
      "Up, up it goes, \n",
      "\n",
      "And yet never grows? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Easy!” said Bilbo. “Mountain, I suppose.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Does it guess easy? It must have a \n",
      "competition with us, my preciouss! If precious \n",
      "asks, and it doesn’t answer, we eats it, my \n",
      "preciousss. If it asks us, and we doesn’t \n",
      "answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We \n",
      "shows it the way out, yes!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“All right!” said Bilbo, not daring to \n",
      "disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think \n",
      "of riddles that could save him from being eaten. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty white horses on a red hill, \n",
      "First they champ, \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they stamp, \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they stand still. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all he could think of to ask — the \n",
      "idea of eating was rather on his mind. It was \n",
      "rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the \n",
      "answer as well as you do. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Chestnuts, chestnuts,” he hissed. “Teeth! \n",
      "teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!” Then \n",
      "he asked his second: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Voiceless it cries, \n",
      "Wingless flutters, \n",
      "Toothless bites, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "he had once heard something rather like this \n",
      "before, and getting his wits back he thought of \n",
      "the answer. “Wind, wind of course,” he said, \n",
      "and he was so pleased that he made up one on \n",
      "the spot. “This’ll puzzle the nasty little \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An eye in a blue face \n",

      "another time. As it was, talking offish, “no-legs” \n",
      "was not so very difficult, and after that the rest \n",
      "was easy. “Fish on a little table, man at table \n",
      "sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones” that of \n",
      "course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave it. \n",
      "Then he thought the time had come to ask \n",

      "He flapped into the water and paddled to the \n",

      "he wanted to shout out: “Give me more time! \n",
      "Give me time!” But all that came out with a \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "time he did not go back to the boat. He sat \n",

      "“Ask us! ask us!” said Gollum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; \n",
      "he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his \n",

      "ring he had picked up in the passage and \n",
      "forgotten about. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What have I got in my pocket?” he said \n",
      "aloud. He was talking to himself, but Gollum \n",

      "upset. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not fair! not fair!” he hissed. “It isn’t fair, my \n",

      "\n",

      "having nothing better to ask stuck to his \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Very well! Guess away!” said Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "taken his hand out again. “Guess again!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“S-s-s-s-s,” said Gollum more upset than \n",
      "ever. He thought of all the things he kept in his \n",
      "own pockets: fish-bones, goblins’ teeth, wet \n",
      "shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to \n",
      "sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. \n",
      "He tried to think what other people kept in their \n",
      "pockets. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Knife!” he said at last. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Wrong!” said Bilbo, who had lost his some \n",
      "time ago. “Last guess!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gollum was in a much worse state \n",
      "than when Bilbo had asked him the egg- \n",
      "question. He hissed and spluttered and rocked \n",
      "himself backwards and forwards, and slapped \n",
      "his feet on the floor, and wriggled and \n",
      "squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his \n",
      "last guess. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on!” said Bilbo. “I am waiting!” He \n",
      "tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not \n",
      "feel at all sure how the game was going to end, \n",
      "whether Gollum guessed right or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Time’s up!” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“String, or nothing!” shrieked Gollum, which \n",
      "was not quite fair — working in two guesses at \n",
      "once. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Both wrong,” cried Bilbo very much \n",
      "relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put \n",
      "his back to the nearest wall, and held out his \n",
      "little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle- \n",
      "game was sacred and of immense antiquity, \n",
      "and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat \n",
      "when they played at it. But he felt he could not \n",
      "trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a \n",
      "pinch. Any excuse would do for him to slide out \n",
      "of it. And after all that last question had not \n",
      "been a genuine riddle according to the ancient \n",
      "laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "But at any rate Gollum did not at once \n",
      "attack him. He could see the sword in Bilbo’s \n",
      "hand. He sat still, shivering and whispering. At \n",
      "last Bilbo could wait no longer. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” he said. “What about your promise? \n",
      "I want to go. You must show me the way.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty \n",
      "little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what \n",
      "has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string, \n",
      "precious, but not nothing. Oh no! gollum!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never you mind,” said Bilbo. “A promise is \n",
      "a promise.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Cross it is, impatient, precious,” hissed \n",
      "Gollum. “But it must wait, yes it must. We can’t \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get \n",
      "some things first, yes, things to help us.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, hurry up!” said Bilbo, relieved to think \n",
      "of Gollum going away. He thought he was just \n",
      "making an excuse and did not mean to come \n",
      "back. What was Gollum talking about? What \n",
      "useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? \n",
      "But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come \n",
      "back. He was angry now and hungry. And he \n",
      "was a miserable wicked creature, and already \n",
      "he had a plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not far away was his island, of which Bilbo \n",
      "knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place he \n",
      "kept a few wretched oddments, and one very \n",
      "beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. He \n",
      "had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "“My birthday-present!” he whispered to \n",
      "himself, as he had often done in the endless \n",
      "dark days. “That’s what we wants now, yes; we \n",
      "wants it!” \n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted it because it was a ring of \n",
      "power, and if you slipped that ring on your \n",
      "finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight \n",
      "could you be seen, and then only by your \n",
      "shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. \n",
      "\n",
      "“My birthday-present! It came to me on my \n",
      "birthday, my precious.” So he had always said \n",
      "to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by \n",
      "that present, ages ago in the old days when \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "such rings were still at large in the world? \n",
      "Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could \n",
      "not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till \n",
      "it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next \n",
      "his skin, till it galled him; and now usually he hid \n",
      "it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was \n",
      "always going back to look at it. And still \n",
      "sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear \n",
      "to be parted from it any longer, or when he was \n",
      "very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he \n",
      "would creep along dark passages looking for \n",
      "stray goblins. He might even venture into places \n",
      "where the torches were lit and made his eyes \n",
      "blink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, \n",
      "quite safe. No one would see him, no one would \n",
      "notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat. \n",
      "Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught \n",
      "a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still \n",
      "had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted \n",
      "something softer. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite safe, yes,” he whispered to himself. \n",
      "“It won’t see us, will it, my precious? No. It won’t \n",
      "see us, and its nassty little sword will be \n",
      "useless, yes quite.” \n",
      "\n",
      "That is what was in his wicked little mind, as \n",
      "he slipped suddenly from Bilbo’s side, and \n",
      "flapped back to his boat, and went off into the \n",
      "dark. Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. \n",
      "Still he waited a while; for he had no idea how \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to find his way out alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a \n",
      "shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing and \n",
      "wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the \n",
      "sound of it. He was on his island, scrabbling \n",
      "here and there, searching and seeking in vain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where iss it? Where iss it?” Bilbo heard \n",
      "him crying. “Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! \n",
      "Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter?” Bilbo called. “What \n",
      "have you lost?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“It mustn’t ask us,” shrieked Gollum. \"Not its \n",
      "business, no, gollum! It’s losst, gollum, gollum, \n",
      "gollum.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, so am I,” cried Bilbo, “and I want to \n",
      "get unlost. And I won the game, and you \n",
      "promised. So come along! Come and let me \n",
      "out, and then go on with your looking!” Utterly \n",
      "miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not \n",
      "find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling \n",
      "that anything Gollum wanted so much could \n",
      "hardly be something good. “Come along!” he \n",
      "shouted. \n",
      "\n",
      "“No, not yet, precious!” Gollum answered. \n",
      "“We must search for it, it’s lost, gollum.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“But you never guessed my last question, \n",
      "and you promised,” said Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never guessed!” said Gollum. Then \n",
      "suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It \n",
      "must tell first.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Bilbo knew, there was no \n",
      "particular reason why he should not tell. \n",
      "Gollum’s mind had jumped to a guess quicker \n",
      "than his; naturally, for Gollum had brooded for \n",
      "ages on this one thing, and he was always \n",
      "afraid of its being stolen. But Bilbo was \n",
      "annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the \n",
      "game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. “Answers \n",
      "were to be guessed not given,” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "“But it wasn’t a fair question,” said Gollum. \n",
      "“Not a riddle, precious, no.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh well, if it’s a matter of ordinary \n",
      "questions,” Bilbo replied, “then I asked one first. \n",
      "What have you lost? Tell me that!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What has it got in its pocketses?” The \n",
      "sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as \n",
      "he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now \n",
      "saw two small points of light peering at him. As \n",
      "suspicion grew in Gollum’s mind, the light of his \n",
      "eyes burned with a pale flame. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you lost?” Bilbo persisted. \n",
      "\n",
      "But now the light in Gollum’s eyes had \n",
      "become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly \n",
      "nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling \n",
      "wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage \n",
      "of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no \n",
      "sword had any more terror for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo could not guess what had maddened \n",
      "the wretched creature, but he saw that all was \n",
      "up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any \n",
      "rate. Just in time he turned and ran blindly back \n",
      "up the dark passage down which he had come, \n",
      "keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his \n",

      "\n",
      "“What has it got in its pocketses?” he heard \n",
      "the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as \n",
      "Gollum leapt from his boat. “What have I, I \n",
      "wonder?” he said to himself, as he panted and \n",
      "stumbled along. He put his left hand in his \n",
      "pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly \n",
      "slipped on to his groping forefinger. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hiss was close behind him. He turned \n",
      "now and saw Gollum’s eyes like small green \n",
      "lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to \n",
      "run faster, but suddenly he struck his toes on a \n",

      "passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing and \n",
      "whispering as he ran. \n",
      "\n",
      "What could it mean? Gollum could see in \n",
      "the dark. Bilbo could see the light of his eyes \n",
      "palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got \n",
      "up, and sheathed his sword, which was now \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he \n",
      "followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It \n",
      "was no good crawling back down to Gollum’s \n",
      "water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might \n",
      "lead him to some way of escape without \n",
      "meaning to. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Curse it! curse it! curse it!” hissed Gollum. \n",
      "“Curse the Baggins! It’s gone! What has it got \n",
      "in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my \n",
      "precious. He’s found it, yes he must have. My \n",
      "birthday-present.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last \n",
      "beginning to guess himself. He hurried a little, \n",
      "getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, \n",
      "who was still going quickly, not looking back, \n",
      "but turning his head from side to side, as Bilbo \n",
      "could see from the faint glimmer on the walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "“My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we \n",
      "lose it, my precious? Yes, that’s it. When we \n",
      "came this way last, when we twisted that nassty \n",
      "young squeaker. That’s it. Curse it! It slipped \n",
      "from us, after all these ages and ages! It’s \n",
      "gone, gollum.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to \n",
      "weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to \n",
      "listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself \n",
      "against the tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum \n",
      "stopped weeping and began to talk. He \n",
      "seemed to be having an argument with himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no good going back there to search, \n",
      "no. We doesn’t remember all the places we’ve \n",

      "we says.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "“We guesses, precious, only guesses. We \n",
      "can’t know till we find the nassty creature and \n",
      "squeezes it. But it doesn’t know what the \n",
      "present can do, does it? It’ll just keep it in its \n",
      "pocketses. It doesn’t know, and it can’t go far. \n",
      "It’s lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn’t \n",

      "\n",
      "“It said so, yes; but it’s tricksy. It doesn’t say \n",

      "\n",
      "“The goblinses will catch it then. It can’t get \n",

      "\n",
      "“Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if \n",
      "it’s got the present, our precious present, then \n",
      "goblinses will get it, gollum! They’ll find it, they’ll \n",
      "find out what it does. We shan’t ever be safe \n",
      "again, never, gollum! One of the goblinses will \n",
      "put it on, and then no one will see him. He’ll be \n",
      "there but not seen. Not even our clever eyeses \n",
      "will notice him; and he’ll come creepsy and \n",
      "tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Then let’s stop talking, precious, and make \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "haste, tf the Baggins has gone that way, we \n",
      "must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make \n",
      "haste!” \n",
      "\n",
      "With a spring Gollum got up and started \n",
      "shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo hurried \n",
      "after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear \n",
      "now was of tripping on another snag and falling \n",
      "with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope \n",
      "and wonder. It seemed that the ring he had was \n",
      "a magic ring: it made you invisible! He had \n",
      "heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; \n",
      "but it was hard to believe that he really had \n",
      "found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum \n",
      "with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a \n",
      "yard to one side. \n",
      "\n",
      "On they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, \n",
      "hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind going as \n",
      "softly as a hobbit can. Soon they came to \n",
      "places where, as Bilbo had noticed on the way \n",
      "down, side-passages opened, this way and \n",
      "that. Gollum began at once to count them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, \n",
      "yes. Two left, yes, yes.” And so on and on. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the count grew he slowed down, and he \n",
      "began to get shaky and weepy; for he was \n",
      "leaving the water further and further behind, and \n",
      "he was getting afraid. Goblins might be about, \n",
      "and he had lost his ring. At last he stopped by a \n",
      "low opening, on their left as they went up. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!” he \n",
      "whispered. “This is it. This is the way to the \n",
      "back-door, yes. Here’s the passage!” \n",
      "\n",
      "He peered in, and shrank back. “But we \n",
      "dursn’t go in, precious, no we dursn’t. \n",
      "Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We \n",
      "smells them. Ssss!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall we do? Curse them and crush \n",
      "them! We must wait here, precious, wait a bit \n",
      "and see.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had \n",
      "brought Bilbo to the way out after all, but Bilbo \n",
      "could not get in! There was Gollum sitting \n",
      "humped up right in the opening, and his eyes \n",
      "gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from \n",
      "side to side between his knees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly \n",
      "than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and \n",
      "sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed \n",
      "softly but menacingly. He could not see the \n",
      "hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had \n",
      "other senses that the darkness had sharpened: \n",
      "hearing and smell. He seemed to be crouched \n",
      "right down with his flat hands splayed on the \n",
      "floor, and his head thrust out, nose almost to the \n",
      "stone. Though he was only a black shadow in \n",
      "the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or \n",
      "feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered \n",
      "for a spring. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went \n",
      "stiff himself. He was desperate. He must get \n",
      "away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had \n",
      "any strength left. He must fight. He must stab \n",
      "the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to \n",
      "kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible \n",
      "now. Gollum had no sword. Gollum had not \n",
      "actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. \n",
      "And he was miserable, alone, lost. A sudden \n",
      "understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled \n",
      "up in Bilbo’s heart: a glimpse of endless \n",
      "unmarked days without light or hope of \n",
      "betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and \n",
      "whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash \n",
      "of a second. He trembled. And then quite \n",
      "suddenly in another flash, as if lifted by a new \n",
      "strength and resolve, he leaped. \n",
      "\n",
      "No great leap for a man, but a leap in the \n",
      "dark. Straight over Gollum’s head he jumped, \n",
      "seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, \n",
      "had he known it, he only just missed cracking \n",
      "his skull on the low arch of the passage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum threw himself backwards, and \n",
      "grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too \n",
      "late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, \n",
      "falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the \n",
      "new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum \n",
      "was doing. There was a hissing and cursing \n",
      "almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. All at \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled \n",
      "with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. \n",
      "He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his \n",
      "prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever \n",
      "cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo’s \n",
      "heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint \n",
      "as an echo, but menacing, the voice came \n",
      "behind: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thief, thief, thief! Bag gins! We hates it, we \n",
      "hates it, we hates it for ever!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a silence. But that too \n",
      "seemed menacing to Bilbo. “If goblins are so \n",
      "near that he smelt them,” he thought, “then they’ll \n",
      "have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful \n",
      "now, or this way will lead you to worse things.” \n",
      "\n",
      "The passage was low and roughly made. It \n",
      "was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, \n",
      "in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes \n",
      "again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in \n",
      "the floor. “A bit low for goblins, at least for the \n",
      "big ones,” thought Bilbo, not knowing that even \n",
      "the big ones, the ores of the mountains, go \n",
      "along at a great speed stooping low with their \n",
      "hands almost on the ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the passage that had been sloping \n",
      "down began to go up again, and after a while it \n",
      "climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at \n",
      "last the slope stopped, the passage turned a \n",
      "corner and dipped down again, and there, at \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering \n",
      "round another corner — a glimpse of light. Not \n",
      "red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of- \n",
      "doors sort of light. Then Bilbo began to run. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him \n",
      "he turned the last corner and came suddenly \n",
      "right into an open space, where the light, after \n",
      "all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly \n",
      "bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in \n",
      "through a doorway, where a great door, a stone \n",
      "door, was left standing open. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the \n",
      "goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn \n",
      "swords sitting just inside the door, and watching \n",
      "it with wide eyes, and watching the passage \n",
      "that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for \n",
      "anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "They saw him sooner than he saw them. \n",
      "Yes, they saw him. Whether it was an accident, \n",
      "or a last trick of the ring before it took a new \n",
      "master, it was not on his finger. With yells of \n",
      "delight the goblins rushed upon him. \n",
      "\n",
      "A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of \n",
      "Gollum’s misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting \n",
      "even to draw his sword he struck his hands into \n",
      "his pockets. And there was the ring still, in his \n",
      "left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The \n",
      "goblins stopped short. They could not see a \n",
      "sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled twice \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as loud as before, but not so delightedly. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is it?” they cried. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Go back up the passage!” some shouted. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This way!” some yelled. “That way!” others \n",
      "yelled. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Look out for the door,” bellowed the \n",
      "captain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords \n",
      "rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither \n",
      "and thither, falling over one another and getting \n",
      "very angry. There was a terrible outcry, to-do, \n",
      "and disturbance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had \n",
      "the sense to understand what had happened \n",
      "and to sneak behind a big barrel which held \n",
      "drink for the goblin-guards, and so get out of the \n",
      "way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to \n",
      "death, or caught by feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I must get to the door, I must get to the \n",
      "door!” he kept on saying to himself, but it was a \n",
      "long time before he ventured to try. Then it was \n",
      "like a horrible game of blind-man’s-buff. The \n",
      "place was full of goblins running about, and the \n",
      "poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was \n",
      "knocked over by a goblin who could not make \n",
      "out what he had bumped into, scrambled away \n",
      "on all fours, slipped between the legs of the \n",
      "captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move \n",
      "it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He \n",
      "squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was \n",
      "awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge \n",
      "of the door and the door-post. He could see \n",
      "outside into the open air: there were a few \n",
      "steps running down into a narrow valley \n",
      "between tall mountains; the sun came out from \n",
      "behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside \n",
      "of the door — but he could not get through. \n",
      "\n",

      "“There is a shadow by the door. Something is \n",
      "outside!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo’s heart jumped into his mouth. He \n",
      "gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all \n",

      "waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat, \n",
      "while bewildered goblins were still picking up \n",
      "his nice brass buttons on the doorstep. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course they soon came down after him, \n",
      "hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the \n",
      "trees. But they don’t like the sun: it makes their \n",
      "legs wobble and their heads giddy. They could \n",
      "not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and \n",
      "out of the shadow of the trees, running quick \n",
      "and quiet, and keeping out of the sun; so soon \n",

      "Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not \n",

      "food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He \n",
      "wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink \n",
      "westwards — behind the mountains. Their \n",

      "beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought was growing inside him. He wondered \n",
      "whether he ought not, now he had the magic \n",

      "He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw \n",

      "a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He \n",

      "\n",
      "All the others laughed too. After all they had \n",
      "lost a good deal, but they had killed the Great \n",
      "Goblin and a great many others besides, and \n",
      "they had all escaped, so they might be said to \n",

      "\n",
      "But the wizard called them to their senses. \n",
      "‘‘We must be getting on at once, now we are a \n",

      "heart of the mountains, and are now on the \n",
      "other side — quite a short cut. But we are not at \n",
      "the point to which our pass would have brought \n",
      "us; we are too far to the North, and have some \n",
      "awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty \n",
      "high up. Let’s get on!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am dreadfully hungry,” groaned Bilbo, who \n",

      "side for something to eat; but the blackberries \n",
      "were still only in flower, and of course there \n",
      "were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. He \n",
      "nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a \n",
      "small mountain-stream that crossed the path, \n",

      "on its bank, but it was not much good. \n",

      "vanished, and they found themselves at the top \n",
      "of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the \n",
      "remains of a landslide. When they began to go \n",
      "down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled \n",
      "away from their feet; soon larger bits of split \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "them seemed on the move, and they were \n",
      "sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful \n",
      "confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs \n",
      "and stones. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was the trees at the bottom that saved \n",
      "them. They slid into the edge of a climbing \n",
      "wood of pines that here stood right up the \n",
      "mountain slope from the deeper darker forests \n",
      "of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the \n",
      "trunks and swung themselves into lower \n",
      "branches, some (like the little hobbit) got \n",
      "behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of \n",
      "the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide \n",
      "had stopped, and the last faint crashes could \n",
      "be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones \n",

      "\n",
      "“Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it \n",

      "beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he \n",
      "could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud \n",
      "noise. “My toes are all bruised and bent, and \n",

      "answered by another away to the right and a \n",
      "good deal nearer to them; then by another not \n",
      "far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the \n",
      "moon, wolves gathering together! \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no wolves living near Mr. \n",
      "Baggins’ hole at home, but he knew that noise. \n",
      "He had had it described to him often enough in \n",
      "tales. One of his elder cousins (on the Took \n",
      "side), who had been a great traveller, used to \n",
      "imitate it to frighten him. To hear it out in the \n",
      "forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo. \n",
      "Even magic rings are not much use against \n",
      "wolves — especially against the evil packs that \n",
      "lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested \n",
      "mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the \n",
      "borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort \n",
      "smell keener than goblins, and do not need to \n",
      "see you to catch you! \n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall we do, what shall we do!” he \n",
      "cried. “Escaping goblins to be caught by \n",

      "\n",
      "“Up the trees quick!” cried Gandalf; and \n",

      "hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "were slender enough to swarm up. They found \n",
      "them as quick as ever they could, you can \n",
      "guess; and up they went as high as ever they \n",

      "laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen \n",
      "the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their \n",
      "beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone \n",
      "cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili \n",
      "were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous \n",
      "Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin \n",
      "were more comfortable in a huge pine with \n",
      "regular branches sticking out at intervals like \n",
      "the spokes of a wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, \n",
      "and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin \n",
      "had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few \n",
      "branches and were trying to find a place to sit in \n",
      "the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, \n",
      "who was a good deal taller than the others, had \n",
      "found a tree into which they could not climb, a \n",
      "large pine standing at the very edge of the \n",
      "glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but \n",
      "you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon \n",
      "as he peeped out. \n",
      "\n",
      "And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, \n",
      "and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like \n",

      "after it. \n",

      "he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the \n",
      "tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his \n",
      "back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just at that moment the wolves trotted \n",
      "howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there \n",
      "were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still \n",
      "Dori did not let Bilbo down. He waited till he \n",
      "had clambered off his shoulders into the \n",
      "branches, and then he jumped for the branches \n",
      "himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped at his \n",
      "cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a \n",
      "minute there was a whole pack of them yelping \n",
      "all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, \n",
      "with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil \n",
      "wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named) \n",
      "cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe. \n",
      "Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are \n",
      "not very comfortable to sit in for long at any \n",
      "time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "all round below waiting for you, they can be \n",
      "perfectly miserable places. \n",
      "\n",
      "This glade in the ring of trees was evidently \n",
      "a meeting-place of the wolves. More and more \n",
      "kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of \n",
      "the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then \n",
      "went snuffling about till they had smelt out every \n",
      "tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded \n",
      "too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it \n",
      "seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the \n",
      "glade; and in the middle of the circle was a \n",
      "great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the \n",
      "dreadful language of the Wargs. Gandalf \n",
      "understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded \n",
      "terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about \n",
      "cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now \n",
      "and then all the Wargs in the circle would \n",
      "answer their grey chief all together, and their \n",
      "dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall \n",
      "out of his pine-tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though \n",
      "Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the \n",
      "goblins often helped one another in wicked \n",
      "deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far \n",
      "from their mountains, unless they are driven out \n",
      "and are looking for new homes, or are \n",
      "marching to war (which I am glad to say has not \n",
      "happened for a long while). But in those days \n",
      "they sometimes used to go on raids, especially \n",
      "to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they \n",
      "often got the Wargs to help and shared the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on \n",
      "wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed \n",
      "that a great goblin-raid had been planned for \n",
      "that very night. The Wargs had come to meet \n",
      "the goblins and the goblins were late. The \n",
      "reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great \n",
      "Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the \n",
      "dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom \n",
      "they were probably still hunting. \n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the dangers of this far land bold \n",
      "men had of late been making their way back \n",
      "into it from the South, cutting down trees, and \n",
      "building themselves places to live in among the \n",
      "more pleasant woods in the valleys and along \n",
      "the river-shores. There were many of them, and \n",
      "they were brave and well-armed, and even the \n",
      "Wargs dared not attack them if there were \n",
      "many together, or in the bright day. But now they \n",
      "had planned with the goblins’ help to come by \n",
      "night upon some of the villages nearest the \n",
      "mountains. If their plan had been carried out, \n",
      "there would have been none left there next day; \n",
      "all would have been killed except the few the \n",
      "goblins kept from the wolves and carried back \n",
      "as prisoners to their caves. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only \n",
      "because of the brave woodmen and their wives \n",
      "and children, but also because of the danger \n",
      "which now threatened Gandalf and his friends. \n",
      "The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding \n",
      "them here in their very meeting-place. They \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought they were friends of the woodmen, and \n",
      "were come to spy on them, and would take \n",
      "news of their plans down into the valleys, and \n",
      "then the goblins and the wolves would have to \n",
      "fight a terrible battle instead of capturing \n",
      "prisoners and devouring people waked \n",
      "suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no \n",
      "intention of going away and letting the people \n",
      "up the trees escape, at any rate not until \n",
      "morning. And long before that, they said, goblin \n",
      "soldiers would be coming down from the \n",
      "mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut \n",
      "them down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now you can understand why Gandalf, \n",
      "listening to their growling and yelping, began to \n",
      "be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and \n",
      "to feel that they were in a very bad place, and \n",
      "had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was \n",
      "not going to let them have it all their own way, \n",
      "though he could not do very much stuck up in a \n",
      "tall tree with wolves all round on the ground \n",
      "below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from \n",
      "the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight \n",
      "with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down \n",
      "among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on \n",
      "the back, and immediately his shaggy coat \n",
      "caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro \n",
      "yelping horribly. Then another came and \n",
      "another, one in blue flames, one in red, another \n",
      "in green. They burst on the ground in the middle \n",
      "of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf \n",
      "on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, \n",
      "and then rushed round and round the circle \n",
      "biting and snapping even at the other wolves in \n",
      "his anger and fright. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and \n",
      "cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to \n",
      "see, and the commotion they made filled all the \n",
      "forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but \n",
      "this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a \n",
      "spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into \n",
      "them, and unless they rolled over quick they \n",
      "were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the \n",
      "glade wolves were rolling over and over to put \n",
      "out the sparks on their backs, while those that \n",
      "were burning were running about howling and \n",
      "setting others alight, till their own friends chased \n",
      "them away and they fled off down the slopes \n",
      "crying and yammering and looking for water. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?” \n",
      "said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting, \n",
      "black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely \n",
      "pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the \n",
      "mountains. “I hear wolves’ voices! Are the \n",
      "goblins at mischief in the woods?” \n",
      "\n",
      "He swept up into the air, and immediately \n",
      "two of his guards from the rocks at either hand \n",
      "leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the \n",
      "sky and looked down upon the ring of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles \n",
      "have keen eyes and can see small things at a \n",
      "great distance. The Lord of the Eagles of the \n",
      "Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the \n",
      "sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving \n",
      "on the ground a mile below even in the \n",
      "moonlight. So though he could not see the \n",
      "people in the trees, he could make out the \n",
      "commotion among the wolves and see the tiny \n",
      "flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping \n",
      "come up faint from far beneath him. Also he \n",
      "could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears \n",
      "and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk \n",
      "crept down the hillsides from their gate and \n",
      "wound into the wood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are \n",
      "cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the \n",
      "northern mountains were the greatest of all \n",
      "birds; they were proud and strong and noble- \n",
      "hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. \n",
      "When they took any notice of them at all (which \n",
      "was seldom, for they did not eat such \n",
      "creatures), they swooped on them and drove \n",
      "them shrieking back to their caves, and \n",
      "stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. \n",
      "The goblins hated the eagles and feared them, \n",
      "but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive \n",
      "them from the mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled \n",
      "with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he \n",
      "summoned many other eagles to him, and they \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "flew away from the mountains, and slowly \n",
      "circling ever round and round they came down, \n",
      "down, down towards the ring of the wolves and \n",
      "the meeting-place of the goblins. \n",
      "\n",
      "A very good thing too! Dreadful things had \n",
      "been going on down there. The wolves that had \n",
      "caught fire and fled into the forest had set it \n",
      "alight in several places, it was high summer, \n",
      "and on this eastern side of the mountains there \n",
      "had been little rain for some time. Yellowing \n",
      "bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine- \n",
      "needles, and here and there dead trees, were \n",
      "soon in flames. All round the clearing of the \n",
      "Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did \n",
      "not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they \n",
      "were leaping and howling round the trunks, and \n",
      "cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, \n",
      "with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes \n",
      "shining as red and fierce as the flames. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly goblins came running up \n",
      "yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen \n",
      "was going on; but they soon learned what had \n",
      "really happened. Some of them actually sat \n",
      "down and laughed. Others waved their spears \n",
      "and clashed the shafts against their shields. \n",
      "Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had \n",
      "a plan which seemed to them most amusing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some got all the wolves together in a pack. \n",
      "Some stacked fern and brushwood round the \n",
      "tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped \n",
      "and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the flames were put out — but they did not put \n",
      "out the fire nearest to the trees where the \n",
      "dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and \n",
      "dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a \n",
      "ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, \n",
      "a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; \n",
      "but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was \n",
      "licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke \n",
      "was in Bilbo’s eyes, he could feel the heat of \n",
      "the flames; and through the reek he could see \n",
      "the goblins dancing round and round in a circle \n",
      "like people round a midsummer bonfire. \n",
      "Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears \n",
      "and axes stood the wolves at a respectful \n",
      "distance, watching and waiting. \n",
      "\n",
      "He could hear the goblins beginning a \n",
      "horrible song: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen birds in five fir-trees, \n",
      "\n",
      "their feathers were fanned in a fiery \n",
      "\n",
      "breeze! \n",
      "\n",
      "But, funny little birds, they had no wings! \n",
      "\n",
      "O what shall we do with the funny little \n",
      "things? \n",
      "\n",
      "Roast ’em alive, orstewthem in a pot; \n",
      "fry them, boil them and eat them hot? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they stopped and shouted out: “Fly \n",
      "away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come \n",
      "down little birds, or you will get roasted in your \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don’t you \n",
      "sing?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Go away! little boys!” shouted Gandalf in \n",
      "answer. “It isn’t bird-nesting time. Also naughty \n",
      "little boys that play with fire get punished.” He \n",
      "said it to make them angry, and to show them \n",
      "he was not frightened of them — though of \n",
      "course he was, wizard though he was. But they \n",
      "took no notice, and they went on singing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bum, bum tree and fern! \n",
      "\n",
      "Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch \n",
      "To light the night for our delight, \n",
      "\n",
      "Ya hey! \n",
      "\n",
      "Bake and toast ’em, fry and roast ’em! \n",
      "till beards blaze, and eyes glaze; \n",
      "till hair smells and skins crack, \n",
      "fat melts, and bones black \n",
      "in cinders lie \n",
      "beneath the sky! \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that Ya hoy\\ the flames were \n",
      "under Gandalf s tree. In a moment it spread to \n",
      "the others. The bark caught fire, the lower \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "branches cracked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. \n",
      "The sudden splendour flashed from his wand \n",
      "like lightning, as he got ready to spring down \n",
      "from on high right among the spears of the \n",
      "goblins. That would have been the end of him, \n",
      "though he would probably have killed many of \n",
      "them as he came hurtling down like a \n",
      "thunderbolt. But he never leaped. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles \n",
      "swept down from above, seized him in his \n",
      "talons, and was gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a howl of anger and surprise from \n",
      "the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, \n",
      "to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept \n",
      "the great birds that were with him, and down \n",
      "they came like huge black shadows. The \n",
      "wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the \n",
      "goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung \n",
      "their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them \n",
      "swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their \n",
      "beating wings smote them to the floor or drove \n",
      "them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. \n",
      "Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the \n",
      "dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far \n",
      "as they ever dared to go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind \n",
      "again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori’s \n",
      "legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they went together above the tumult and the \n",
      "burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms \n",
      "nearly breaking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now far below the goblins and the wolves \n",
      "were scattering far and wide in the woods. A \n",
      "few eagles were still circling and sweeping \n",
      "above the battleground. The flames about the \n",
      "trees sprang suddenly up above the highest \n",
      "branches. They went up in crackling fire. There \n",
      "was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo \n",
      "had escaped only just in time! \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the light of the burning was faint \n",
      "below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they \n",
      "were high up in the sky, rising all the time in \n",
      "strong sweeping circles. Bilbo never forgot that \n",
      "flight, clinging onto Dori’s ankles. He moaned \n",
      "“my arms, my arms!”; but Dori groaned “my \n",
      "poor legs, my poor legs!” \n",
      "\n",
      "At the best of times heights made Bilbo \n",
      "giddy. He used to turn queer if he looked over \n",
      "the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never \n",
      "liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had \n",
      "to escape from wolves before). So you can \n",
      "imagine how his head swam now, when he \n",
      "looked down between his dangling toes and \n",
      "saw the dark lands opening wide underneath \n",
      "him, touched here and there with the light of the \n",
      "moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the \n",
      "plains. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pale peaks of the mountains were \n",
      "coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "out of black shadows. Summer or not, it \n",
      "seemed very cold. He shut his eyes and \n",
      "wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then \n",
      "he imagined what would happen if he did not. \n",
      "He felt sick. \n",
      "\n",
      "The flight ended only just in time for him, just \n",
      "before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori’s \n",
      "ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough \n",
      "platform of an eagle’s eyrie. There he lay \n",
      "without speaking, and his thoughts were a \n",
      "mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, \n",
      "and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the \n",
      "deep shadows on either side. He was feeling \n",
      "very queer indeed in his head by this time after \n",
      "the dreadful adventures of the last three days \n",
      "with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself \n",
      "saying aloud: “Now I know what a piece of \n",
      "bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out \n",
      "of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“No you don’t!” he heard Dori answering, \n",
      "“because the bacon knows that it will get back \n",
      "in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped \n",
      "we shan’t. Also eagles aren’t forks!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“O no! Not a bit like storks — forks, I mean,” \n",
      "said Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at \n",
      "the eagle who was perched close by. He \n",
      "wondered what other nonsense he had been \n",
      "saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You \n",
      "ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are \n",
      "only the size of a hobbit, and are up in his eyrie \n",
      "at night! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The eagle only sharpened his beak on a \n",
      "stone and trimmed his feathers and took no \n",
      "notice. \n",

      "not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for \n",

      "hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on \n",
      "cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and \n",
      "wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top \n",
      "of the Carrock at night watching the moon \n",
      "sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I \n",

      "there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb \n",
      "clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of \n",
      "short white sweet honey-smelling clover. There \n",
      "was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in \n",

      "last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate \n",

      "\n",
      "They soon came to a wooden gate, high \n",

      "some thatched and made of unshaped logs: \n",
      "barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden \n",
      "house. Inside on the southward side of the great \n",

      "out filled all the air. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the \n",

      "sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the \n",
      "grass and looked at them intently with very \n",

      "in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was \n",

      "“Who are you and what do you want?” he \n",
      "asked gruffly, standing in front of them and \n",
      "towering tall above Gandalf. As for Bilbo he \n",
      "could easily have trotted through his legs \n",
      "without ducking his head to miss the fringe of \n",
      "the man’s brown tunic. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Gandalf,” said the wizard. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Never heard of him,” growled the man. \n",
      "“And what’s this little fellow?” he said, stooping \n",
      "down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black \n",
      "eyebrows. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good \n",
      "family and unimpeachable reputation,” said \n",
      "Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take \n",
      "off, and was painfully conscious of his many \n",
      "missing buttons. “I am a wizard,” continued \n",
      "Gandalf. “I have heard of you, if you have not \n",
      "heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my \n",
      "good cousin Radagast who lives near the \n",
      "Southern borders of Mirkwood?” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I \n",
      "believe. I used to see him now and again,” said \n",
      "Beorn. “Well, now I know who you are, or who \n",
      "you say you are. What do you want?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“To tell you the truth, we have lost our \n",
      "luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather \n",
      "in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say \n",
      "we have had rather a bad time with goblins in \n",
      "the mountains.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Goblins?” said the big man less gruffly. “O \n",

      "have you? What did you go near them for?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“We did not mean to. They surprised us at \n",
      "night in a pass which we had to cross; we were \n",
      "coming out of the Lands over West into these \n",
      "countries — it is a long tale.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you had better come inside and tell \n",

      "\n",
      "Following him they found themselves in a \n",
      "wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. Though \n",
      "it was summer there was a wood-fire burning \n",
      "and the smoke was rising to the blackened \n",
      "rafters in search of the way out through an \n",
      "opening in the roof. They passed through this \n",
      "dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, \n",
      "and came through another smaller door into a \n",
      "sort of veranda propped on wooden posts \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was still warm and filled with the light of the \n",
      "westering sun which slanted into it, and fell \n",
      "golden on the garden full of flowers that came \n",
      "right up to the steps. \n",

      "\n",
      "Here they sat on wooden benches while \n",
      "Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo swung his \n",
      "dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the \n",
      "garden, wondering what their names could be, \n",
      "as he had never seen half of them before. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I was coming over the mountains with a \n",
      "friend or two. . .” said the wizard. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Or two? I can only see one, and a little one \n",
      "at that,” said Beorn. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to \n",
      "bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you \n",
      "were busy. I will give a call, if I may.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, call away!” \n",
      "\n",
      "So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and \n",

      "before them. \n",
      "\n",

      "and that your companion is respectable, and \n",
      "that you are enemies of goblins and are not up \n",

      "\n",
      "“They are on their way to visit the land of \n",
      "their fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood,” put \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, whistle again! lam in for a party, it \n",

      "\n",
      "Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori \n",

      "\n",
      "“Hullo!” said Beorn. “You came pretty quick \n",

      "the-boxes!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Nori at your service, Ori at. . .” they began; \n",

      "\n",
      "“Troop of ponies? What were you — a \n",

      "\n",
      "“O no! As a matter of fact there were more \n",
      "than six ponies, for there were more than six of \n",
      "us — and well, here are two more!” Just at that \n",
      "moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and \n",
      "bowed so low that their beards swept the stone \n",
      "floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they \n",
      "did their best to be frightfully polite, and kept on \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "nodding and bending and bowing and waving \n",
      "their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf- \n",
      "fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into \n",
      "a chuckling laugh: they looked so comical. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Troop, was right,” he said. “A fine comic \n",
      "one. Come in my merry men, and what are your \n",

      "your names; and then sit down and stop \n",
      "wagging!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Balin and Dwalin,” they said not daring to \n",
      "be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking \n",
      "rather surprised. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now go on again!” said Beorn to the \n",
      "wizard. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where was I? O yes — I was not grabbed. I \n",
      "killed a goblin or two with a flash — ” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” growled Beorn. “It is some good \n",
      "being a wizard, then.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“ — and slipped inside the crack before it \n",
      "closed. I followed down into the main hall, which \n",
      "was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin \n",
      "was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I \n",
      "thought to myself ‘even if they were not all \n",
      "chained together, what can a dozen do against \n",
      "so many?’” \n",
      "\n",
      "“A dozen! That’s the first time I've heard \n",
      "eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some \n",
      "more jacks that haven’t yet come out of their \n",
      "boxes?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "here now — Fili and Kili, I believe,” said Gandalf, \n",

      "“That’s enough!” said Beorn. “Sit down and \n",
      "be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!” \n",
      "\n",
      "So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he \n",
      "came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of \n",
      "the lower gate, and their horror when they found \n",
      "that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. “We \n",
      "counted ourselves and found that there was no \n",
      "hobbit. There were only fourteen of us left!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Fourteen! That’s the first time I’ve heard \n",
      "one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or \n",
      "else you haven’t told me yet all the names of \n",
      "your party.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, of course you haven’t seen Oin and \n",
      "Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope \n",
      "you will forgive them for bothering you.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“O let ’em all come! Hurry up! Come along, \n",
      "you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, \n",
      "even now we have only got yourself and ten \n",
      "dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only \n",
      "makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not \n",
      "fourteen, unless wizards count differently to \n",
      "other people. But now please get on with the \n",
      "tale.” Beorn did not show it more than he could \n",
      "help, but really he had begun to get very \n",
      "interested. You see, in the old days he had \n",
      "known the very part of the mountains that \n",
      "Gandalf was describing. He nodded and he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "growled, when he heard of the hobbit’s \n",
      "reappearance and of their scramble down the \n",
      "stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Gandalf came to their climbing into \n",
      "trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up \n",
      "and strode about and muttered: “I wish I had \n",
      "been there! I would have given them more than \n",
      "fireworks!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said Gandalf very glad to see that \n",
      "his tale was making a good impression, “I did \n",
      "the best I could. There we were with the wolves \n",
      "going mad underneath us and the forest \n",
      "beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins \n",
      "came down from the hills and discovered us. \n",
      "They yelled with delight and sang songs making \n",
      "fun of us. Fifteen birds in live fir-trees . . \n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens!” growled Beorn. “Don’t \n",
      "pretend that goblins can’t count. They can. \n",
      "Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as \n",
      "well. I haven’t ventured to introduce them \n",
      "before, but here they are.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In came Bifur and Bofur. “And me!” gasped \n",
      "Bombur puffing up behind. He was fat, and also \n",
      "angry at being left till last. He refused to wait \n",
      "five minutes, and followed immediately after the \n",
      "other two. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now there are fifteen of you; and \n",
      "since goblins can count, I suppose that is all \n",
      "that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "can finish this story without any more \n",
      "interruptions.” Mr. Baggins saw then how clever \n",
      "Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really \n",
      "made Beorn more interested in the story, and \n",
      "the story had kept him from sending the \n",
      "dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. \n",
      "He never invited people into his house, if he \n",
      "could help it. He had very few friends and they \n",
      "lived a good way away; and he never invited \n",
      "more than a couple of these to his house at a \n",
      "time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in \n",
      "his porch! \n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the wizard had finished his tale \n",
      "and had told of the eagles’ rescue and of how \n",
      "they had all been brought to the Carrock, the \n",
      "sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty \n",
      "Mountains and the shadows were long in \n",
      "Beorn’s garden. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Avery good tale!” said he. “The best I have \n",
      "heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell \n",
      "such a good one, they might find me kinder. \n",
      "You may be making it all up, of course, but you \n",
      "deserve a supper for the story all the same. \n",
      "Let’s have something to eat!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes please!” they all said together. “Thank \n",
      "you very much!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn \n",
      "clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "white ponies and several large long-bodied \n",
      "grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a \n",
      "queer language like animal noises turned into \n",
      "talk. They went out again and soon came back \n",
      "carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at \n",
      "the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars \n",
      "of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs \n",
      "could stand on their hind-legs when they \n",
      "wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. \n",
      "Quickly they got out boards and trestles from \n",
      "the side walls and set them up near the fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then baa — baa — baa! was heard, and in \n",
      "came some snow-white sheep led by a large \n",
      "coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth \n",
      "embroidered at the edges with figures of \n",
      "animals; others bore on their broad backs trays \n",
      "with bowls and platters and knives and wooden \n",
      "spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on \n",
      "the trestle-tables. These were very low, low \n",
      "enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably. \n",
      "Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated \n",
      "benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short \n",
      "thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the \n",
      "far end he put Beorn’s big black chair of the \n",
      "same sort (in which he sat with his great legs \n",
      "stuck far out under the table). These were all the \n",
      "chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had \n",
      "them low like the tables for the convenience of \n",
      "the wonderful animals that waited on him. What \n",
      "did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "other ponies came in rolling round drum- \n",
      "shaped sections of logs, smoothed and \n",
      "polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so \n",
      "soon they were all seated at Beorn’s table, and \n",
      "the hall had not seen such a gathering for many \n",
      "a year. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they had a supper, or a dinner, such \n",
      "as they had not had since they left the Last \n",
      "Homely House in the West and said good-bye \n",
      "to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire \n",
      "flickered about them, and on the table were two \n",
      "tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, \n",
      "Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the \n",
      "wild lands on this side of the mountains, and \n",
      "especially of the dark and dangerous wood, \n",
      "that lay outstretched far to North and South a \n",
      "day’s ride before them, barring their way to the \n",
      "East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves listened and shook their \n",
      "beards, for they knew that they must soon \n",
      "venture into that forest and that after the \n",
      "mountains it was the worst of the perils they had \n",
      "to pass before they came to the dragon’s \n",
      "stronghold. When dinner was over they began \n",
      "to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to \n",
      "be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. \n",
      "They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels \n",
      "and the making of things by smith-craft, and \n",
      "Beorn did not appear to care for such things: \n",
      "there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and few save the knives were made of metal at \n",
      "all. \n",
      "\n",
      "They sat long at the table with their wooden \n",
      "drinking-bowls filled with mead. The dark night \n",
      "came on outside. The fires in the middle of the \n",
      "hall were built with fresh logs and the torches \n",
      "were put out, and still they sat in the light of the \n",
      "dancing flames with the pillars of the house \n",
      "standing tall behind them, and dark at the top \n",
      "like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or \n",
      "not, it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound \n",
      "like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, \n",
      "and the hoot of owls. Soon he began to nod \n",
      "with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far \n",
      "away, until he woke with a start. \n",
      "\n",
      "The great door had creaked and slammed. \n",
      "Beorn was gone. The dwarves were sitting \n",
      "cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and \n",
      "presently they began to sing. Some of the \n",
      "verses were like this, but there were many \n",
      "more, and their singing went on for a long while: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind was on the withered heath, \n",
      "but in the forest stirred no leaf: \n",
      "there shadows lay by night and day, \n",
      "and dark things silent crept beneath. \n",
      "\n",

      "out into the air one after another, green, blue, \n",
      "red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little \n",
      "ones; little ones dodging through big ones and \n",

      "\n",
      "“I have been picking out bear-tracks,” he \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "saw that Beorn could not have made them all: \n",

      "little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and \n",
      "gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from \n",
      "dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost \n",

      "river, from the Mountains. In that direction only \n",
      "one set of footprints led — none coming, only \n",
      "ones going away from here. I followed these as \n",
      "far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into \n",
      "the river, but the water was too deep and strong \n",
      "beyond the rock for me to cross. It is easy \n",
      "enough, as you remember, to get from this bank \n",
      "to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side \n",
      "is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I \n",
      "had to walk miles before I found a place where \n",
      "the river was wide and shallow enough for me \n",
      "to wade and swim, and then miles back again \n",
      "to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was \n",
      "too late for me to follow them far. They went \n",
      "straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on \n",
      "the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we \n",
      "had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the \n",
      "night before last. And now I think I have \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said \n",
      "he was not a friend of theirs.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“So I did. And don’t be silly! You had better \n",
      "go to bed, your wits are sleepy.” \n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there \n",
      "seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; \n",
      "and while the dwarves were still singing songs \n",
      "he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head \n",
      "about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of \n",
      "hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy \n",
      "dances round and round in the moonlight in the \n",
      "courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone \n",
      "else was asleep, and he heard the same \n",
      "scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as \n",
      "before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning they were all wakened by \n",
      "Beorn himself. “So here you all are still!” he \n",
      "said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: “Not \n",
      "eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears \n",
      "yet I see”; and he poked Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat \n",
      "most disrespectfully. “Little bunny is getting nice \n",
      "and fat again on bread and honey,” he \n",
      "chuckled. “Come and have some more!” \n",
      "\n",
      "So they all went to breakfast with him. \n",
      "Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he \n",
      "seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and \n",
      "set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor \n",
      "did they have to wonder long where he had \n",
      "been or why he was so nice to them, for he told \n",
      "them himself. He had been over the river and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "right back up into the mountains — from which \n",
      "you can guess that he could travel quickly, in \n",
      "bear’s shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf- \n",
      "glade he had soon found out that part of their \n",
      "story was true; but he had found more than that: \n",
      "he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering \n",
      "in the woods. From these he had got news: the \n",
      "goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for \n",
      "the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry \n",
      "because of the death of the Great Goblin, and \n",
      "also because of the burning of the chief wolfs \n",
      "nose and the death from the wizard’s fire of \n",
      "many of his chief servants. So much they told \n",
      "him when he forced them, but he guessed there \n",
      "was more wickedness than this afoot, and that \n",
      "a great raid of the whole goblin army with their \n",
      "wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the \n",
      "mountains might soon be made to find the \n",
      "dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and \n",
      "creatures that lived there, and who they thought \n",
      "must be sheltering them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a good story, that of yours,” said \n",
      "Beorn, “but I like it still better now I am sure it is \n",
      "true. You must forgive my not taking your word. \n",
      "If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you \n",
      "would take the word of no one that you did not \n",
      "know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I \n",
      "can only say that I have hurried home as fast as \n",
      "I could to see that you were safe, and to offer \n",
      "you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, \n",
      "killed the Great Goblin!” he chuckled fiercely to \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you do with the goblin and the \n",
      "Warg?” asked Bilbo suddenly. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Come and see!” said Beorn, and they \n",
      "followed round the house. A goblin’s head was \n",
      "stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was \n",
      "nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce \n",
      "enemy. But now he was their friend, and \n",
      "Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole \n",
      "story and the reason of their journey, so that \n",
      "they could get the most help he could offer. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is what he promised to do for them. He \n",
      "would provide ponies for each of them, and a \n",
      "horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, \n",
      "and he would lade them with food to last them \n",
      "for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as \n",
      "easy as possible to carry — nuts, flour, sealed \n",
      "jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of \n",
      "honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep \n",
      "good a long time, and on a little of which they \n",
      "could march far. The making of these was one \n",
      "of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in \n",
      "most of his foods, and they were good to eat, \n",
      "though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, \n",
      "they would not need to carry this side of the \n",
      "forest, for there were streams and springs \n",
      "along the road. “But your way through Mirkwood \n",
      "is dark, dangerous and difficult,” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The \n",
      "time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be \n",
      "past and gone indeed before you get to the \n",
      "other side), and nuts are about all that grows \n",
      "there fit for food; in there the wild things are \n",
      "dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with \n",
      "skins for carrying water, and I will give you \n",
      "some bows and arrows. But I doubt very much \n",
      "whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be \n",
      "wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one \n",
      "stream there, I know, black and strong which \n",
      "crosses the path. That you should neither drink \n",
      "of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries \n",
      "enchantment and a great drowsiness and \n",
      "forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that \n",
      "place I don’t think you will shoot anything, \n",
      "wholesome or unwholesome, without straying \n",
      "from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any \n",
      "reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That is all the advice I can give you. \n",
      "Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you \n",
      "much; you must depend on your luck and your \n",
      "courage and the food I send with you. At the \n",
      "gate of the forest I must ask you to send back \n",
      "my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all \n",
      "speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you \n",
      "come back this way again.’’ \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They thanked him, of course, with many bows \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and sweepings of their hoods and with many an \n",
      "“at your service, O master of the wide wooden \n",
      "halls!” But their spirits sank at his grave words, \n",
      "and they all felt that the adventure was far more \n",
      "dangerous than they had thought, while all the \n",
      "time, even if they passed all the perils of the \n",
      "road, the dragon was waiting at the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "All that morning they were busy with \n",
      "preparations. Soon after midday they ate with \n",
      "Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they \n",
      "mounted the steeds he was lending them, and \n",
      "bidding him many farewells they rode off \n",
      "through his gate at a good pace. \n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they left his high hedges at the \n",
      "east of his fenced lands they turned north and \n",
      "then bore to the north-west. By his advice they \n",
      "were no longer making for the main forest-road \n",
      "to the south of his land. Had they followed the \n",
      "pass, their path would have led them down a \n",
      "stream from the mountains that joined the great \n",
      "river miles south of the Carrock. At that point \n",
      "there was a deep ford which they might have \n",
      "passed, if they had still had their ponies, and \n",
      "beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood \n",
      "and to the entrance of the old forest road. But \n",
      "Beorn had warned them that that way was now \n",
      "often used by the goblins, while the forest-road \n",
      "itself, he had heard, was overgrown and \n",
      "disused at the eastern end and led to \n",
      "impassable marshes where the paths had long \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "been lost. Its eastern opening had also always \n",
      "been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, \n",
      "and would have left them still with a long and \n",
      "difficult northward march when they got to the \n",
      "other side. North of the Carrock the edge of \n",
      "Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the \n",
      "Great River, and though here the Mountains too \n",
      "drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take \n",
      "this way; for at a place a few days’ ride due \n",
      "north of the Carrock was the gate of a little- \n",
      "known pathway through Mirkwood that led \n",
      "almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The goblins,” Beorn had said, “will not dare \n",
      "to cross the Great River for a hundred miles \n",
      "north of the Carrock nor to come near my house \n",
      "— it is well protected at night! — but I should ride \n",
      "fast; for if they make their raid soon they will \n",
      "cross the river to the south and scour all the \n",
      "edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and \n",
      "Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are \n",
      "safer going north, even though you seem to be \n",
      "going back nearer to their strongholds; for that \n",
      "is what they will least expect, and they will have \n",
      "the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick \n",
      "as you may!” \n",
      "\n",
      "That is why they were now riding in silence, \n",
      "galloping wherever the ground was grassy and \n",
      "smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, \n",
      "and in the distance the line of the river with its \n",
      "trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "turned west when they started, and till evening it \n",
      "lay golden on the land about them. It was \n",
      "difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and \n",
      "when they had put many miles between them \n",
      "and Beorn’s house they began to talk and to \n",
      "sing again and to forget the dark forest-path \n",
      "that lay in front. But in the evening when the \n",
      "dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains \n",
      "glowered against the sunset they made a camp \n",
      "and set a guard, and most of them slept \n",
      "uneasily with dreams in which there came the \n",
      "howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still the next morning dawned bright and fair \n",
      "again. There was an autumn-like mist white \n",
      "upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon \n",
      "the sun rose red in the East and the mists \n",
      "vanished, and while the shadows were still long \n",
      "they were off again. So they rode now for two \n",
      "more days, and all the while they saw nothing \n",
      "save grass and flowers and birds and scattered \n",
      "trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer \n",
      "browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. \n",
      "Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts \n",
      "sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he \n",
      "thought they were the dead branches of trees. \n",
      "That third evening they were so eager to press \n",
      "on, for Beorn had said that they should reach \n",
      "the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they \n",
      "rode still forward after dusk and into the night \n",
      "beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, \n",
      "the shadowy form of a great bear prowling \n",
      "along in the same direction. But if he dared to \n",
      "mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: \n",
      "“Hush! Take no notice!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Next day they started before dawn, though \n",
      "their night had been short. As soon as it was \n",
      "light they could see the forest coming as it were \n",
      "to meet them, or waiting for them like a black \n",

      "to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit \n",
      "that a silence began to draw in upon them. \n",
      "Birds began to sing less. There were no more \n",
      "deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. By the \n",
      "afternoon they had reached the eaves of \n",
      "Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the \n",
      "great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. \n",
      "Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their \n",

      "The dwarves were inclined to grumble at \n",
      "this, but the wizard told them they were fools. \n",
      "“Beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, \n",
      "and you had better keep your promises anyway, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins’ eyes are \n",
      "sharper than yours, if you have not seen each \n",

      "or sitting far off in the moon watching our \n",

      "but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn \n",
      "may be your friend, but he loves his animals as \n",
      "his children. You do not guess what kindness he \n",
      "has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so \n",
      "far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if \n",

      "but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they \n",
      "found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the \n",
      "ponies. They distributed the packages as fairly \n",
      "as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot was \n",
      "wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the \n",
      "idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that \n",
      "on his back. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you worry!” said Thorin. “It will get \n",

      "begins to run short.” \n",

      "“There is, if you care to go two hundred \n",
      "miles or so out of your way north, and twice that \n",
      "south. But you wouldn’t get a safe path even \n",
      "then. There are no safe paths in this part of the \n",
      "world. Remember you are over the Edge of the \n",
      "Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you \n",

      "description. Before you could get round it in the \n",
      "South, you would get into the land of the \n",
      "Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won’t need \n",
      "me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don’t \n",
      "advise you to go anywhere near the places \n",
      "overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the \n",
      "forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the \n",
      "best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you \n",

      "the light at the gate was like a little bright hole \n",
      "far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their \n",

      "seeing things he could catch glimpses of them \n",
      "whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree- \n",

      "among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick \n",
      "in places on the forest-floor; but what made the \n",

      "wind on their faces. There was no movement of \n",
      "air down under the forest-roof, and it was \n",
      "everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even the \n",
      "dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and \n",

      "pitch-dark — not what you call pitch-dark, but \n",
      "really pitch: so black that you really could see \n",
      "nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of \n",
      "his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, \n",
      "perhaps it is not true to say that they could see \n",
      "nothing: they could see eyes. They slept all \n",
      "closely huddled together, and took it in turns to \n",
      "watch; and when it was Bilbo’s turn he would \n",
      "see gleams in the darkness round them, and \n",
      "sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes \n",
      "would stare at him from a little distance, and \n",
      "then slowly fade and disappear and slowly \n",
      "shine out again in another place. And \n",
      "sometimes they would gleam down from the \n",
      "branches just above him; and that was most \n",
      "terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least \n",
      "were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. “Insect \n",
      "eyes,” he thought, “not animal eyes, only they \n",
      "are much too big.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Although it was not yet very cold, they tried \n",
      "lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave \n",

      "creatures, whatever they were, were careful \n",
      "never to let their bodies show in the little flicker \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big \n",
      "as your hand, flapping and whirring round their \n",

      "All this went on for what seemed to the \n",

      "for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get \n",
      "low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and \n",
      "they wasted many arrows before they managed \n",
      "to bring one down on the path. But when they \n",
      "roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they \n",
      "shot no more squirrels. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were thirsty too, for they had none too \n",
      "much water, and in all the time they had seen \n",
      "neither spring nor stream. This was their state \n",
      "when one day they found their path blocked by \n",
      "a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not \n",
      "very wide right across the way, and it was \n",
      "black, or looked it in the gloom. It was well that \n",
      "Beorn had warned them against it, or they \n",
      "would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, \n",
      "and filled some of their emptied skins at its \n",
      "bank. As it was they only thought of how to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "cross it without wetting themselves in its water. \n",
      "There had been a bridge of wood across, but it \n",

      "posts near the bank. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering \n",

      "“Twelve yards! I should have thought it was \n",
      "thirty at least, but my eyes don’t see as well as \n",
      "they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve \n",
      "yards is as good as a mile. We can’t jump it, \n",

      "“Can any of you throw a rope?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the good of that? The boat is sure \n",

      "“I don’t believe it is tied,” said Bilbo, “though \n",
      "of course I can’t be sure in this light; but it looks \n",

      "\n",
      "the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Fili thought he could; so when he had stared \n",
      "a long while to get an idea of the direction, the \n",
      "others brought him a rope. They had several \n",
      "with them, and on the end of the longest they \n",
      "fastened one of the large iron hooks they had \n",
      "used for catching their packs to the straps \n",
      "about their shoulders. Fili took this in his hand, \n",
      "balanced it for a moment, and then flung it \n",
      "across the stream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Splash it fell in the water! “Not far enough!” \n",
      "said Bilbo who was peering forward. “A couple \n",
      "of feet and you would have dropped it on to the \n",
      "boat. Try again. I don’t suppose the magic is \n",
      "strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit \n",
      "of wet rope.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn \n",
      "it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time \n",
      "he threw it with great strength. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Steady!” said Bilbo, “you have thrown it \n",
      "right into the wood on the other side now. Draw \n",
      "it back gently.” Fili hauled the rope back slowly, \n",
      "and after a while Bilbo said: “Carefully! It is lying \n",
      "on the boat; let’s hope the hook will catch.” \n",
      "\n",
      "It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in \n",
      "vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and \n",
      "Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly \n",
      "they all fell over on their backs. Bilbo was on the \n",
      "look out, however, caught the rope, and with a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "piece of stick fended off the little black boat as \n",
      "it came rushing across the stream. “Help!” he \n",
      "shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the \n",
      "boat before it floated off down the current. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It was tied after all,” said he, looking at the \n",
      "snapped painter that was still dangling from it. \n",
      "“That was a good pull, my lads; and a good job \n",
      "that our rope was the stronger.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall,” said Thorin, “and you will come with \n",
      "me, and Fili and Balin. That’s as many as the \n",
      "boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin \n",
      "and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and \n",
      "Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.” \n",

      "something bad will happen to you.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“There aren’t any oars. How are you going \n",
      "to push the boat back to the far bank?” asked \n",
      "the hobbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me another length of rope and \n",
      "another hook,” said Fili, and when they had got \n",
      "it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and \n",
      "as high as he could throw it. Since it did not fall \n",
      "down again, they saw that it must have stuck in \n",
      "the branches. “Get in now,” said Fili, “and one \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of you haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on \n",
      "the other side. One of the others must keep \n",
      "hold of the hook we used at first, and when we \n",
      "are safe on the other side he can hook it on, \n",
      "and you can draw the boat back.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In this way they were all soon on the far \n",
      "bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin \n",
      "had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on \n",
      "his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was \n",
      "getting ready to follow, when something bad did \n",
      "happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on \n",
      "the path ahead. Out of the gloom came \n",
      "suddenly the shape of a flying deer, it charged \n",
      "into the dwarves and bowled them over, then \n",
      "gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and \n",
      "cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did \n",
      "not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was \n",
      "the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. \n",
      "As soon as they had landed he had bent his \n",
      "bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden \n",
      "guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a \n",
      "swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it \n",
      "reached the further bank it stumbled. The \n",
      "shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the \n",
      "sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before they could shout in praise of the \n",
      "shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all \n",
      "thoughts of venison out of their minds. “Bombur \n",
      "has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!” he cried. It \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on \n",
      "the land when the hart bore down on him, and \n",
      "sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the \n",
      "boat away from the bank, and then toppled \n",
      "back into the dark water, his hands slipping off \n",
      "the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span \n",
      "slowly off and disappeared. \n",
      "\n",
      "They could still see his hood above the \n",
      "water when they ran to the bank. Quickly, they \n",
      "flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand \n",
      "caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He \n",
      "was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but \n",
      "that was not the worst. When they laid him on \n",
      "the bank he was already fast asleep, with one \n",
      "hand clutching the rope so tight that they could \n",
      "not get it from his grasp; and fast asleep he \n",
      "remained in spite of all they could do. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were still standing over him, cursing \n",
      "their ill luck, and Bombur’s clumsiness, and \n",
      "lamenting the loss of the boat which made it \n",
      "impossible for them to go back and look for the \n",
      "hart, when they became aware of the dim \n",
      "blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as \n",
      "of dogs baying far off. Then they all fell silent; \n",
      "and as they sat it seemed they could hear the \n",
      "noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the \n",
      "path, though they saw no sign of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they sat for a long while and did not \n",
      "dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared \n",
      "for all the troubles that vexed them. Suddenly on \n",
      "the path ahead appeared some white deer, a \n",
      "hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had \n",
      "been dark. They glimmered in the shadows. \n",
      "Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves \n",
      "had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows \n",
      "from their bows. None seemed to find their \n",
      "mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees \n",
      "as silently as they had come, and in vain the \n",
      "dwarves shot their arrows after them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop! stop!” shouted Thorin; but it was too \n",
      "late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last \n",
      "arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given \n",
      "them were useless. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were a gloomy party that night, and the \n",
      "gloom gathered still deeper on them in the \n",
      "following days. They had crossed the \n",
      "enchanted stream; but beyond it the path \n",
      "seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the \n",
      "forest they could see no change. Yet if they had \n",
      "known more about it and considered the \n",
      "meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had \n",
      "appeared upon their path, they would have \n",
      "known that they were at last drawing towards \n",
      "the eastern edge, and would soon have come, \n",
      "if they could have kept up their courage and \n",
      "their hope, to thinner trees and places where \n",
      "the sunlight came again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But they did not know this, and they were \n",
      "burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which \n",
      "they had to carry along with them as best they \n",
      "could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four \n",
      "each while the others shared their packs. If \n",
      "these had not become all too light in the last few \n",
      "days, they would never have managed it; but a \n",
      "slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor \n",
      "exchange for packs filled with food however \n",
      "heavy. In a few days a time came when there \n",
      "was practically nothing left to eat or to drink. \n",
      "Nothing wholesome could they see growing in \n",
      "the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale \n",
      "leaves and unpleasant smell. \n",
      "\n",
      "About four days from the enchanted stream \n",
      "they came to a part where most of the trees \n",
      "were beeches. They were at first inclined to be \n",
      "cheered by the change, for here there was no \n",
      "undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. \n",
      "There was a greenish light about them, and in \n",
      "places they could see some distance to either \n",
      "side of the path. Yet the light only showed them \n",
      "endless lines of straight grey trunks like the \n",
      "pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a \n",
      "breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a \n",
      "sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to \n",
      "remind them that outside autumn was coming \n",
      "on. Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of \n",
      "countless other autumns that drifted over the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "banks of the path from the deep red carpets of \n",
      "the forest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still Bombur slept and they grew very \n",
      "weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. \n",
      "Sometimes there was singing in the distance \n",
      "too. The laughter was the laughter of fair voices \n",
      "not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but \n",
      "it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not \n",
      "comforted, rather they hurried on from those \n",
      "parts with what strength they had left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two days later they found their path going \n",
      "downwards, and before long they were in a \n",
      "valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth \n",
      "of oaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there no end to this accursed forest?” \n",
      "said Thorin. “Somebody must climb a tree and \n",
      "see if he can get his head above the roof and \n",
      "have a look round. The only way is to choose \n",
      "the tallest tree that overhangs the path.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course “somebody” meant Bilbo. They \n",
      "chose him, because to be of any use the \n",
      "climber must get his head above the topmost \n",
      "leaves, and so he must be light enough for the \n",
      "highest and slenderest branches to bear him. \n",
      "Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice \n",
      "in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into \n",
      "the lowest branches of an enormous oak that \n",
      "grew right out into the path, and up he had to go \n",
      "as best he could. He pushed his way through \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; \n",
      "he was greened and grimed from the old bark \n",
      "of the greater boughs; more than once he \n",
      "slipped and caught himself just in time; and at \n",
      "last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place \n",
      "where there seemed to be no convenient \n",
      "branches at all, he got near the top. All the time \n",
      "he was wondering whether there were spiders \n",
      "in the tree, and how he was going to get down \n",
      "again (except by falling). \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end he poked his head above the roof \n",
      "of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. \n",
      "But they were only small ones of ordinary size, \n",
      "and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo’s eyes \n",
      "were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear \n",
      "the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, \n",
      "but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. \n",
      "The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long \n",
      "while before he could bear it. When he could, \n",
      "he saw all round him a sea of dark green, \n",
      "ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there \n",
      "were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I \n",
      "expect they were a kind of “purple emperor”, a \n",
      "butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but \n",
      "these were not purple at all, they were a dark \n",
      "dark velvety black without any markings to be \n",
      "seen. \n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the “black emperors” for a \n",
      "long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "his hair and on his face; but at length the cries \n",
      "of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping \n",
      "with impatience down below, reminded him of \n",
      "his real business. It was no good. Gaze as \n",
      "much as he might, he could see no end to the \n",
      "trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, \n",
      "that had been lightened by the sight of the sun \n",
      "and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: \n",
      "there was no food to go back to down below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, as I have told you, they were not far \n",
      "off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had \n",
      "the sense to see it, the tree that he had \n",
      "climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing \n",
      "near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its \n",
      "top the trees seemed to swell up all round like \n",
      "the edges of a great bowl, and he could not \n",
      "expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he \n",
      "did not see this, and he climbed down full of \n",
      "despair. He got to the bottom again at last, \n",
      "scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not \n",
      "see anything in the gloom below when he got \n",
      "there. His report soon made the others as \n",
      "miserable as he was. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The forest goes on for ever and ever and \n",
      "ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? \n",
      "And what is the use of sending a hobbit!\" they \n",
      "cried, as if it was his fault. They did not care \n",
      "tuppence about the butterflies, and were only \n",
      "made more angry when he told them of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to \n",
      "climb up and feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they ate their very last scraps and \n",
      "crumbs of food; and next morning when they \n",
      "woke the first thing they noticed was that they \n",
      "were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing \n",
      "was that it was raining and that here and there \n",
      "the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest \n",
      "floor. That only reminded them that they were \n",
      "also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to \n",
      "relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst \n",
      "by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a \n",
      "chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only \n",
      "scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly \n",
      "from Bombur. \n",
      "\n",
      "He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching \n",
      "his head. He could not make out where he was \n",
      "at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had \n",
      "forgotten everything that had happened since \n",
      "they started their journey that May morning long \n",
      "ago. The last thing that he remembered was the \n",
      "party at the hobbit’s house, and they had great \n",
      "difficulty in making him believe their tale of all \n",
      "the many adventures they had had since. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard that there was nothing to \n",
      "eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and wobbly in the legs. “Why ever did I wake \n",
      "up!” he cried. “I was having such beautiful \n",
      "dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest \n",
      "rather like this one, only lit with torches on the \n",
      "trees and lamps swinging from the branches \n",
      "and fires burning on the ground; and there was \n",
      "a great feast going on, going on for ever. A \n",
      "woodland king was there with a crown of \n",
      "leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I \n",
      "could not count or describe the things there \n",
      "were to eat and drink.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“You need not try,” said Thorin. “In fact if you \n",
      "can’t talk about something else, you had better \n",
      "be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with \n",
      "you as it is. If you hadn’t waked up, we should \n",
      "have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; \n",
      "you are no joke to carry even after weeks of \n",
      "short commons.” \n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing now to be done but to \n",
      "tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, \n",
      "and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and \n",
      "trudge along the track without any great hope of \n",
      "ever getting to the end before they lay down and \n",
      "died of starvation. This they did all that day, \n",
      "going very slowly and wearily; while Bombur \n",
      "kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him \n",
      "and that he wanted to lie down and sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "“No you don’t!” they said. “Let your legs \n",
      "take their share, we have carried you far \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "enough.” \n",
      "\n",
      "All the same he suddenly refused to go a \n",
      "step further and flung himself on the ground. “Go \n",
      "on, if you must,” he said. “I’m just going to lie \n",
      "here and sleep and dream of food, if I can’t get \n",
      "it any other way. I hope I never wake up again.” \n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment Balin, who was a little \n",
      "way ahead, called out: “What was that? I \n",
      "thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest.” \n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked, and a longish way off, it \n",
      "seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; \n",
      "then another and another sprang out beside it. \n",
      "Even Bombur got up, and they hurried along \n",
      "then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The \n",
      "light was in front of them and to the left of the \n",
      "path, and when at last they had drawn level with \n",
      "it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were \n",
      "burning under the trees, but a good way off their \n",
      "track. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks as if my dreams were coming true,” \n",
      "gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted \n",
      "to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. \n",
      "But the others remembered only too well the \n",
      "warnings of the wizard and of Beorn. \n",
      "\n",
      "“A feast would be no good, if we never got \n",
      "back alive from it,” said Thorin. \n",
      "\n",
      "“But without a feast we shan’t remain alive \n",
      "much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo \n",
      "heartily agreed with him. They argued about it \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "backwards and forwards for a long while, until \n",
      "they agreed at length to send out a couple of \n",
      "spies, to creep near the lights and find out more \n",
      "about them. But then they could not agree on \n",
      "who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to \n",
      "run the chance of being lost and never finding \n",
      "his friends again. In the end, in spite of \n",
      "warnings, hunger decided them, because \n",
      "Bombur kept on describing all the good things \n",
      "that were being eaten, according to his dream, \n",
      "in the woodland feast; so they all left the path \n",
      "and plunged into the forest together. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a good deal of creeping and crawling \n",
      "they peered round the trunks and looked into a \n",
      "clearing where some trees had been felled and \n",
      "the ground levelled. There were many people \n",
      "there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green \n",
      "and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the \n",
      "felled trees in a great circle. There was a fire in \n",
      "their midst and there were torches fastened to \n",
      "some of the trees round about; but most \n",
      "splendid sight of all: they were eating and \n",
      "drinking and laughing merrily. \n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of the roast meats was so \n",
      "enchanting that, without waiting to consult one \n",
      "another, every one of them got up and \n",
      "scrambled forwards into the ring with the one \n",
      "idea of begging for some food. No sooner had \n",
      "the first stepped into the clearing than all the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "lights went out as if by magic. Somebody \n",
      "kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of \n",
      "glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost \n",
      "in a completely lightless dark and they could not \n",
      "even find one another, not for a long time at any \n",
      "rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom, \n",
      "falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and \n",
      "shouting and calling till they must have waked \n",
      "everything in the forest for miles, at last they \n",
      "managed to gather themselves in a bundle and \n",
      "count themselves by touch. By that time they \n",
      "had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction \n",
      "the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at \n",
      "least till morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing for it but to settle down \n",
      "for the night where they were; they did not even \n",
      "dare to search on the ground for scraps of food \n",
      "for fear of becoming separated again. But they \n",
      "had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just \n",
      "getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to \n",
      "watch first, said in a loud whisper: \n",
      "\n",
      "“The lights are coming out again over there, \n",
      "and there are more than ever of them.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not \n",
      "far away were scores of twinkling lights, and \n",
      "they heard the voices and the laughter quite \n",
      "plainly. They crept slowly towards them, in a \n",
      "single line, each touching the back of the one in \n",
      "front. When they got near Thorin said: “No \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "rushing forward this time! No one is to stir from \n",
      "hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone \n",
      "first to talk to them. They won’t be frightened of \n",
      "him — (‘What about me of them?’ thought Bilbo) \n",
      "— and any way I hope they won’t do anything \n",
      "nasty to him.” \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If it had been difficult collecting themselves \n",
      "before, it was far worse this time. And they \n",
      "simply could not find the hobbit. Every time they \n",
      "counted themselves it only made thirteen. They \n",
      "shouted and called: “Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! \n",
      "You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, \n",
      "where are you?” and other things of that sort, \n",
      "but there was no answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were just giving up hope, when Dori \n",
      "stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark \n",
      "he fell over what he thought was a log, and he \n",
      "found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. It \n",
      "took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when \n",
      "he was awake he was not pleased at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I was having such a lovely dream,” he \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens! he has gone like Bombur,” \n",
      "they said. “Don’t tell us about dreams. Dream- \n",

      "them.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“They are the best I am likely to get in this \n",
      "beastly place,” he muttered, as he lay down \n",

      "sleep and find his dream again. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that was not the last of the lights in the \n",
      "forest. Later when the night must have been \n",
      "getting old, Kili who was watching then, came \n",

      "nearer and try once more to get help. Up they \n",
      "got again; and this time the result was \n",
      "disastrous. The feast that they now saw was \n",
      "greater and more magnificent than before; and \n",
      "at the head of a long line of feasters sat a \n",
      "woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his \n",
      "golden hair, very much as Bombur had \n",

      "folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and \n",
      "across the fires, and some were harping and \n",
      "many were singing. Their gleaming hair was \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "twined with flowers; green and white gems \n",

      "out stepped Thorin in to their midst. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dead silence fell in the middle of a word. \n",
      "Out went all light. The fires leaped up in black \n",
      "smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of \n",
      "the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with \n",
      "their clamour and their cries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo found himself running round and round \n",

      "steadily further and fainter, and though after a \n",
      "while it seemed to him they changed to yells \n",
      "and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at \n",
      "last died right away, and he was left alone in \n",
      "complete silence and darkness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That was one of his most miserable moments. \n",

      "some little light, and quite useless to go \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "blundering about tiring himself out with no hope \n",
      "of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself \n",
      "down with his back to a tree, and not for the last \n",
      "time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole \n",
      "with its beautiful pantries. He was deep in \n",
      "thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and \n",
      "butter when he felt something touch him. \n",
      "Something like a strong sticky string was \n",
      "against his left hand, and when he tried to move \n",
      "he found that his legs were already wrapped in \n",
      "the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell \n",
      "over. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the great spider, who had been busy \n",
      "tying him up while he dozed, came from behind \n",
      "him and came at him. He could only see the \n",
      "thing’s eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it \n",
      "struggled to wind its abominable threads round \n",
      "and round him. It was lucky that he had come to \n",
      "his senses in time. Soon he would not have \n",
      "been able to move at all. As it was, he had a \n",
      "desperate fight before he got free. He beat the \n",
      "creature off with his hands — it was trying to \n",
      "poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders \n",
      "do to flies — until he remembered his sword and \n",
      "drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and \n",
      "he had time to cut his legs loose. After that it \n",
      "was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was \n",
      "not used to things that carried such stings at \n",
      "their sides, or it would have hurried away \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "quicker. Bilbo came at it before it could \n",
      "disappear and stuck it with his sword right in \n",
      "the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and \n",
      "danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, \n",
      "until he killed it with another stroke; and then he \n",
      "fell down and remembered nothing more for a \n",
      "long while. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was the usual dim grey light of the \n",
      "forest-day about him when he came to his \n",
      "senses. The spider lay dead beside him, and \n",
      "his sword-blade was stained black. Somehow \n",
      "the killing of the giant spider, all alone by \n",
      "himself in the dark without the help of the wizard \n",
      "or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great \n",
      "difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different \n",
      "person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of \n",
      "an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on \n",
      "the grass and put it back into its sheath. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I will give you a name,” he said to it, “and I \n",
      "shall call you Sting.” \n",
      "\n",
      "After that he set out to explore. The forest \n",
      "was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of \n",
      "all to look for his friends, who were not likely to \n",
      "be very far off, unless they had been made \n",
      "prisoners by the elves (or worse things). Bilbo \n",
      "felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a \n",
      "long while wondering in what direction the path \n",
      "lay, and in what direction he should go first to \n",
      "look for the dwarves. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“O! why did we not remember Beorn’s \n",
      "advice, and Gandalfs!” he lamented. “What a \n",
      "mess we are in now! We! I only wish it was i/ie: \n",
      "it is horrible being all alone.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end he made as good a guess as he \n",
      "could at the direction from which the cries for \n",
      "help had come in the night — and by luck (he \n",
      "was born with a good share of it) he guessed \n",
      "more or less right, as you will see. Having made \n",
      "up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he \n",
      "could. Hobbits are clever at quietness, \n",
      "especially in woods, as I have already told you; \n",
      "also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he \n",
      "started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor \n",
      "heard him coming. \n",
      "\n",
      "He had picked his way stealthily for some \n",
      "distance, when he noticed a place of dense \n",
      "black shadow ahead of him, black even for that \n",
      "forest, like a patch of midnight that had never \n",
      "been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw \n",
      "that it was made by spider-webs one behind \n",
      "and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he \n",
      "saw, too, that there were spiders huge and \n",
      "horrible sitting in the branches above him, and \n",
      "ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they \n",
      "should discover him. Standing behind a tree he \n",
      "watched a group of them for some time, and \n",
      "then in the silence and stillness of the wood he \n",
      "realised that these loathsome creatures were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "speaking one to another. Their voices were a \n",
      "sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could \n",
      "make out many of the words that they said. \n",
      "They were talking about the dwarves! \n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a sharp struggle, but worth it,” said \n",
      "one. “What nasty thick skins they have to be \n",
      "sure, but I'll wager there is good juice inside.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, they’ll make fine eating, when they’ve \n",
      "hung a bit,” said another. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t hang ’em too long,” said a third. \n",
      "“They’re not as fat as they might be. Been \n",
      "feeding none too well of late, I should guess.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Kill ’em, I say,” hissed a fourth; “kill ’em \n",
      "now and hang ’em dead for a while.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re dead now, I’ll warrant,” said the \n",
      "first. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That they are not. I saw one a-struggling \n",
      "just now. Just coming round again, I should say, \n",
      "after a bee-autiful sleep. I’ll show you.” \n",
      "\n",
      "With that one of the fat spiders ran along a \n",
      "rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a \n",
      "row from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, \n",
      "now that he noticed them for the first time \n",
      "dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot \n",
      "sticking out of the bottoms of some of the \n",
      "bundles, or here and there the tip of a nose, or \n",
      "a bit of beard or of a hood. \n",
      "\n",
      "To the fattest of these bundles the spider \n",
      "went — “It is poor old Bombur, I’ll bet,” thought \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo — and nipped hard at the nose that stuck \n",
      "out. There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe \n",
      "shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard. \n",
      "There was life in Bombur still. There was a \n",
      "noise like the kicking of a flabby football, and \n",
      "the enraged spider fell off the branch, only \n",
      "catching itself with its own thread just in time. \n",
      "\n",
      "The others laughed. “You were quite right,” \n",
      "they said, “the meat’s alive and kicking!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll soon put an end to that,” hissed the \n",
      "angry spider climbing back onto the branch. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he \n",
      "must do something. He could not get up at the \n",
      "brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but \n",
      "looking about he saw that in this place there \n",
      "were many stones lying in what appeared to be \n",
      "a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty \n",
      "fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him \n",
      "long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that \n",
      "fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he used to \n",
      "practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits \n",
      "and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way \n",
      "as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and \n",
      "even grownup he had still spent a deal of his \n",
      "time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the \n",
      "wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the aiming and throwing sort — indeed he could \n",
      "do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, \n",
      "asking riddles and cooking, that I haven’t had \n",
      "time to tell you about. There is no time now. \n",
      "While he was picking up stones, the spider had \n",
      "reached Bombur, and soon he would have \n",
      "been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The \n",
      "stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it \n",
      "dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the \n",
      "ground, with all its legs curled up. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next stone went whizzing through a big \n",
      "web, snapping its cords, and taking off the \n",
      "spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. \n",
      "After that there was a deal of commotion in the \n",
      "spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a \n",
      "bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but \n",
      "they could make a good guess at the direction \n",
      "from which the stones were coming. As quick \n",
      "as lightning they came running and swinging \n",
      "towards the hobbit, flinging out their long \n",
      "threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of \n",
      "waving snares. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a \n",
      "different place. The idea came to him to lead \n",
      "the furious spiders further and further away from \n",
      "the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, \n",
      "excited and angry all at once. When about fifty \n",
      "had gone off to the place where he had stood \n",
      "before, he threw some more stones at these, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and at others that had stopped behind; then \n",
      "dancing among the trees he began to sing a \n",
      "song to infuriate them and bring them all after \n",
      "him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is what he sang: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Old fat spider spinning in a tree! \n",
      "\n",
      "Old fat spider cant see me! \n",
      "Attercop! Attercop! \n",
      "\n",
      "Wont you stop, \n",
      "\n",
      "Stop your spinning and look forme? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Tomnoddy, all big body, \n",
      "\n",
      "Old Tomnoddy cant spy me! \n",
      "Attercop! Attercop! \n",
      "\n",
      "Down you drop! \n",
      "\n",
      "Youll never catch me up your tree! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not very good perhaps, but then you must \n",
      "remember that he had to make it up himself, on \n",
      "the spur of a very awkward moment. It did what \n",
      "he wanted any way. As he sang he threw some \n",
      "more stones and stamped. Practically all the \n",
      "spiders in the place came after him: some \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dropped to the ground, others raced along the \n",
      "branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new \n",
      "ropes across the dark spaces. They made for \n",
      "his noise far quicker than he had expected. \n",
      "They were frightfully angry. Quite apart from the \n",
      "stones no spider has ever liked being called \n",
      "Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting \n",
      "to anybody. \n",
      "\n",
      "Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but \n",
      "several of the spiders had run now to different \n",
      "points in the glade where they lived, and were \n",
      "busy spinning webs across all the spaces \n",
      "between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit \n",
      "would be caught in a thick fence of them all \n",
      "round him — that at least was the spiders’ idea. \n",
      "Standing now in the middle of the hunting and \n",
      "spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his courage \n",
      "and began a new song: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lazy Lob and crazy Cob \n",
      "are weaving webs to wind me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am far more sweet than other meat, \n",
      "but still they cannot find me! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here am I, naughty little fly; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "you are fat and lazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot trap me, though you try, \n",
      "in your cobwebs crazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he turned and found that the last \n",
      "space between two tall trees had been closed \n",
      "with a web — but luckily not a proper web, only \n",
      "great strands of double-thick spider-rope run \n",
      "hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to \n",
      "trunk. Out came his little sword. He slashed the \n",
      "threads to pieces and went off singing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The spiders saw the sword, though I don’t \n",
      "suppose they knew what it was, and at once the \n",
      "whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit \n",
      "along the ground and the branches, hairy legs \n",
      "waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes \n",
      "popping, full of froth and rage. They followed \n",
      "him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as \n",
      "he dared. Then quieter than a mouse he stole \n",
      "back. \n",
      "\n",
      "He had precious little time, he knew, before \n",
      "the spiders were disgusted and came back to \n",
      "their trees where the dwarves were hung. In the \n",
      "meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst \n",
      "part of the job was getting up on to the long \n",
      "branch where the bundles were dangling. I don’t \n",
      "suppose he would have managed it, if a spider \n",
      "had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he \n",
      "scrambled up — only to meet an old slow wicked \n",
      "fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to \n",
      "guard the prisoners, and had been busy \n",
      "pinching them to see which was the juiciest to \n",
      "eat. it had thought of starting the feast while the \n",
      "others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a \n",
      "hurry, and before the spider knew what was \n",
      "happening it felt his sting and rolled off the \n",
      "branch dead. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo’s next job was to loose a dwarf. What \n",
      "was he to do? If he cut the string which hung \n",
      "him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump \n",
      "to the ground a good way below. Wriggling \n",
      "along the branch (which made all the poor \n",
      "dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he \n",
      "reached the first bundle. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Fili or Kili,” he thought by the tip of a blue \n",
      "hood sticking out at the top. “Most likely Fili,\" he \n",
      "thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of \n",
      "the winding threads. He managed by leaning \n",
      "over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that \n",
      "bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a \n",

      "rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the \n",

      "\n",
      "Bilbo immediately went to the end of the \n",
      "branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back \n",
      "those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now we see you, you nasty little creature! \n",
      "We will eat you and leave your bones and skin \n",

      "he? Well, we’ll get him all the same, and then \n",
      "we’ll hang him head downwards for a day or \n",
      "two.” \n",
      "\n",
      "While this was going on, the other dwarves \n",
      "were working at the rest of the captives, and \n",
      "cutting at the threads with their knives. Soon all \n",
      "would be free, though it was not clear what \n",
      "would happen after that. The spiders had \n",
      "caught them pretty easily the night before, but \n",
      "that had been unawares and in the dark. This \n",
      "time there looked like being a horrible battle. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the \n",
      "spiders had gathered round old Bombur on the \n",
      "floor, and had tied him up again and were \n",
      "dragging him away. He gave a shout and \n",
      "slashed at the spiders in front of him. They \n",
      "quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell \n",
      "down the tree right into the middle of those on \n",
      "the ground. His little sword was something new \n",
      "in the way of stings for them. How it darted to \n",
      "and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at \n",
      "them. Half a dozen were killed before the rest \n",
      "drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Come down! Come down!” he shouted to \n",
      "the dwarves on the branch. “Don’t stay up there \n",
      "and be netted!” For he saw spiders swarming \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling \n",
      "along the boughs above the heads of the \n",
      "dwarves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or \n",
      "dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very \n",
      "shaky and little use on their legs. There they \n",
      "were at last, twelve of them counting poor old \n",
      "Bombur, who was being propped up on either \n",
      "side by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; \n",
      "and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his \n",
      "Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were \n",
      "goggling at them all round and about and \n",
      "above. It looked pretty hopeless. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the battle began. Some of the \n",
      "dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and \n",
      "all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had \n",
      "his elvish dagger. Again and again the spiders \n",
      "were beaten off, and many of them were killed. \n",
      "But it could not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly \n",
      "tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to \n",
      "stand firmly, and soon they would all be \n",
      "overpowered like weary flies. Already the \n",
      "spiders were beginning to weave their webs all \n",
      "round them again from tree to tree. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end Bilbo could think of no plan \n",
      "except to let the dwarves into the secret of his \n",
      "ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could \n",
      "not be helped. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to disappear,” he said. “I shall \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "draw the spiders off, if I can; and you must keep \n",
      "together and make in the opposite direction. To \n",
      "the left there, that is more or less the way \n",
      "towards the place where we last saw the elf- \n",
      "fires.” \n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult to get them to understand, \n",
      "what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, and \n",
      "the whacking of sticks and the throwing of \n",
      "stones; but at last Bilbo felt he could delay no \n",
      "longer — the spiders were drawing their circle \n",
      "ever closer. He suddenly slipped on his ring, \n",
      "and to the great astonishment of the dwarves \n",
      "he vanished. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon there came the sound of “Lazy Lob” \n",
      "and “Attercop” from among the trees away on \n",
      "the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They \n",
      "stopped advancing, and some went off in the \n",
      "direction of the voice. “Attercop” made them so \n",
      "angry that they lost their wits. Then Balin, who \n",
      "had grasped Bilbo’s plan better than the rest, \n",
      "led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in \n",
      "a knot, and sending a shower of stones they \n",
      "drove at the spiders on the left, and burst \n",
      "through the ring. Away behind them now the \n",
      "shouting and singing suddenly stopped. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been \n",
      "caught the dwarves went on. Not fast enough, \n",
      "though. They were sick and weary, and they \n",
      "could not go much better than a hobble and a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wobble, though many of the spiders were close \n",
      "behind. Every now and then they had to turn and \n",
      "fight the creatures that were overtaking them; \n",
      "and already some spiders were in the trees \n",
      "above them and throwing down their long \n",
      "clinging threads. \n",
      "\n",
      "Things were looking pretty bad again, when \n",
      "suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and charged into \n",
      "the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the \n",
      "side. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on! Go on!” he shouted. “I will do the \n",
      "stinging!” \n",
      "\n",
      "And he did. He darted backwards and \n",
      "forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at \n",
      "their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if \n",
      "they came too near. The spiders swelled with \n",
      "rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed \n",
      "out horrible curses; but they had become \n",
      "mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come \n",
      "very near, now that it had come back. So curse \n",
      "as they would, their prey moved slowly but \n",
      "steadily away. It was a most terrible business, \n",
      "and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when \n",
      "Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a \n",
      "single stroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it \n",
      "up, and followed them no more, but went back \n",
      "disappointed to their dark colony. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves then noticed that they had \n",
      "come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "been. Whether it was one of those they had \n",
      "seen the night before, they could not tell. But it \n",
      "seemed that some good magic lingered in such \n",
      "spots, which the spiders did not like. At any rate \n",
      "here the light was greener, and the boughs less \n",
      "thick and threatening, and they had a chance to \n",
      "rest and draw breath. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they lay for some time, puffing and \n",
      "panting. But very soon they began to ask \n",
      "questions. They had to have the whole \n",
      "vanishing business carefully explained, and the \n",
      "finding of the ring interested them so much that \n",
      "for a while they forgot their own troubles. Balin \n",
      "in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, \n",
      "riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring \n",
      "in its proper place. But after a time the light \n",
      "began to fail, and then other questions were \n",
      "asked. Where were they, and where was their \n",
      "path, and where was there any food, and what \n",
      "were they going to do next? These questions \n",
      "they asked over and over again, and it was \n",
      "from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to \n",
      "get the answers. From which you can see that \n",
      "they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins \n",
      "very much, and had begun to have a great \n",
      "respect for him (as Gandalf had said they \n",
      "would). Indeed they really expected him to think \n",
      "of some wonderful plan for helping them, and \n",
      "were not merely grumbling. They knew only too \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "well that they would soon all have been dead, if \n",
      "it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked \n",
      "him many times. Some of them even got up and \n",
      "bowed right to the ground before him, though \n",
      "they fell over with the effort, and could not get on \n",
      "their legs again for some time. Knowing the \n",
      "truth about the vanishing did not lessen their \n",
      "opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had \n",
      "some wits, as well as luck and a magic ring — \n",
      "and all three are very useful possessions. In fact \n",
      "they praised him so much that Bilbo began to \n",
      "feel there really was something of a bold \n",
      "adventurer about himself after all, though he \n",
      "would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had \n",
      "been anything to eat. \n",
      "\n",
      "But there was nothing, nothing at all; and \n",
      "none of them were fit to go and look for \n",
      "anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost \n",
      "path! No other idea would come into Bilbo’s \n",
      "tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at \n",
      "the endless trees; and after a while they all fell \n",
      "silent again. All except Balin. Long after the \n",
      "others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, \n",
      "he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Gollum! Well I’m blest! So that’s how he \n",
      "sneaked past me, is it? Now I know! Just crept \n",
      "quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all \n",
      "over the doorstep! Good old Bilbo — Bilbo — \n",
      "Bilbo — bo — bo — bo — ” And then he fell asleep, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and there was complete silence for a long \n",
      "while. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and \n",
      "looked round at them. “Where is Thorin?” he \n",
      "asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a terrible shock. Of course there were \n",
      "only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the \n",
      "hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They \n",
      "wondered what evil fate had befallen him, \n",
      "magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as \n",
      "they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off \n",
      "one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of \n",
      "horrible dreams, as evening wore to black \n",
      "night; and there we must leave them for the \n",
      "present, too sick and weary to set guards or to \n",
      "take turns at watching. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thorin had been caught much faster than \n",
      "they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log \n",
      "into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? \n",
      "The next time it had been Thorin who stepped \n",
      "forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a \n",
      "stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves \n",
      "lost in the night, their cries as the spiders \n",
      "caught them and bound them, and all the \n",
      "sounds of the battle next day, had passed over \n",
      "him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come \n",
      "to him, and bound him, and carried him away. \n",
      "\n",
      "The feasting people were Wood-elves, of \n",
      "course. These are not wicked folk. If they have a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their \n",
      "magic was strong, even in those days they were \n",
      "wary. They differed from the High Elves of the \n",
      "West, and were more dangerous and less wise. \n",
      "For most of them (together with their scattered \n",
      "relations in the hills and mountains) were \n",
      "descended from the ancient tribes that never \n",
      "went to Faerie in the West. There the Light- \n",
      "elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves \n",
      "went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and \n",
      "wiser and more learned, and invented their \n",
      "magic and their cunning craft in the making of \n",
      "beautiful and marvellous things, before some \n",
      "came back into the Wide World. In the Wide \n",
      "World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of \n",
      "our Sun and Moon, but loved best the stars; and \n",
      "they wandered in the great forests that grew tall \n",
      "in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often \n",
      "by the edges of the woods, from which they \n",
      "could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run \n",
      "over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; \n",
      "and after the coming of Men they took ever \n",
      "more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. \n",
      "Still elves they were and remain, and that is \n",
      "Good People. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a great cave some miles within the edge \n",
      "of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at \n",
      "this time their greatest king. Before his huge \n",
      "doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the forest and flowed on and out into the \n",
      "marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. \n",
      "This great cave, from which countless smaller \n",
      "ones opened out on every side, wound far \n",
      "underground and had many passages and wide \n",
      "halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome \n",
      "than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep \n",
      "nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the \n",
      "king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, \n",
      "and had houses or huts on the ground and in \n",
      "the branches. The beeches were their favourite \n",
      "trees. The king’s cave was his palace, and the \n",
      "strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of \n",
      "his people against their enemies. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So \n",
      "to the cave they dragged Thorin — not too gently, \n",
      "for they did not love dwarves, and thought he \n",
      "was an enemy. In ancient days they had had \n",
      "wars with some of the dwarves, whom they \n",
      "accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair \n",
      "to say that the dwarves gave a different \n",
      "account, and said that they only took what was \n",
      "their due, for the elf-king had bargained with \n",
      "them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had \n",
      "afterwards refused to give them their pay. If the \n",
      "elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, \n",
      "especially for silver and white gems; and though \n",
      "his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more, \n",
      "since he had not yet as great a treasure as \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "other elf-lords of old. His people neither mined \n",
      "nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother \n",
      "much with trade or with tilling the earth. All this \n",
      "was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin’s \n",
      "family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel \n",
      "I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was \n",
      "angry at their treatment of him, when they took \n",
      "their spell off him and he came to his senses; \n",
      "and also he was determined that no word of \n",
      "gold or jewels should be dragged out of him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he \n",
      "was brought before him, and asked him many \n",
      "questions. But Thorin would only say that he \n",
      "was starving. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you and your folk three times try to \n",
      "attack my people at their merrymaking?” asked \n",
      "the king. \n",
      "\n",
      "“We did not attack them,” answered Thorin; \n",
      "“we came to beg, because we were starving.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are your friends now, and what are \n",
      "they doing?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, but I expect starving in the \n",
      "forest.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“What were you doing in the forest?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Looking for food and drink, because we \n",
      "were starving.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“But what brought you into the forest at all?” \n",
      "asked the king angrily. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "say another word. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well!” said the king. “Take him away \n",
      "and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell \n",
      "the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut \n",
      "him in one of the inmost caves with strong \n",
      "wooden doors, and left him. They gave him \n",
      "food and drink, plenty of both, if not very fine; for \n",
      "Wood-elves were not goblins, and were \n",
      "reasonably well-behaved even to their worst \n",

      "Such day as there ever was in the forest was \n",
      "fading once more into the blackness of night, \n",
      "when suddenly out sprang the light of many \n",
      "torches all round them, like hundreds of red \n",
      "stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows \n",
      "and spears and called the dwarves to halt. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no thought of a fight. Even if the \n",
      "dwarves had not been in such a state that they \n",
      "were actually glad to be captured, their small \n",
      "knives, the only weapons they had, would have \n",
      "been of no use against the arrows of the elves \n",
      "that could hit a bird's eye in the dark. So they \n",
      "simply stopped dead and sat down and waited \n",
      "— all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "slipped quickly to one side. That is why, when \n",
      "the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one \n",
      "behind the other, and counted them, they never \n",
      "found or counted the hobbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along \n",
      "well behind their torch-light as they led off their \n",
      "prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was \n",
      "blindfold, but that did not make much difference, \n",
      "for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not \n",
      "see where they were going, and neither he nor \n",
      "the others knew where they had started from \n",
      "anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up \n",
      "with the torches, for the elves were making the \n",
      "dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and \n",
      "weary as they were. The king had ordered them \n",
      "to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, \n",
      "and the hobbit had just time to catch them up \n",
      "before they began to cross the bridge. This was \n",
      "the bridge that led across the river to the king’s \n",
      "doors. The water flowed dark and swift and \n",
      "strong beneath; and at the far end were gates \n",
      "before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into \n",
      "the side of a steep slope covered with trees. \n",
      "There the great beeches came right down to \n",
      "the bank, till their feet were in the stream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Across the bridge the elves thrust their \n",
      "prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He \n",
      "did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth, \n",
      "and he only made up his mind not to desert his \n",
      "friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of \n",
      "the last elves, before the great gates of the king \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "closed behind them with a clang. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the passages were lit with red torch- \n",
      "light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched \n",
      "along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. \n",
      "These were not like those of the goblin-cities; \n",
      "they were smaller, less deep underground, and \n",
      "filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars \n",
      "hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on \n",
      "a chair of carven wood. On his head was a \n",
      "crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn \n",
      "was come again. In the spring he wore a crown \n",
      "of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a \n",
      "carven staff of oak. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elvenking's Gate. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoners were brought before him; and \n",
      "though he looked grimly at them, he told his \n",
      "men to unbind them, for they were ragged and \n",
      "weary. “Besides they need no ropes in here,” \n",
      "said he. “There is no escape from my magic \n",
      "doors for those who are once brought inside.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Long and searchingly he questioned the \n",
      "dwarves about their doings, and where they \n",
      "were going to, and where they were coming \n",
      "from; but he got little more news out of them \n",
      "than out of Thorin. They were surly and angry \n",
      "and did not even pretend to be polite. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have we done, O king?” said Balin, \n",
      "who was the eldest left. “Is it a crime to be lost \n",
      "in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be \n",
      "trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame \n",
      "beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you \n",
      "angry?” \n",
      "\n",
      "Such a question of course made the king \n",
      "angrier than ever, and he answered: “It is a \n",
      "crime to wander in my realm without leave. Do \n",
      "you forget that you were in my kingdom, using \n",
      "the road that my people made? Did you not \n",
      "three times pursue and trouble my people in the \n",
      "forest and rouse the spiders with your riot and \n",
      "clamour? After all the disturbance you have \n",
      "made I have a right to know what brings you \n",
      "here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep \n",
      "you all in prison until you have learned sense \n",
      "and manners!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he ordered the dwarves each to be \n",
      "put in a separate cell and to be given food and \n",
      "drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of \n",
      "their little prisons, until one at least of them was \n",
      "willing to tell him all he wanted to know. But he \n",
      "did not tell them that Thorin was also a prisoner \n",
      "with him. It was Bilbo who found that out. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Baggins — it was a weary long time \n",
      "that he lived in that place all alone, and always \n",
      "in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "daring to sleep, even tucked away in the \n",
      "darkest and remotest corners he could find. For \n",
      "something to do he took to wandering about the \n",
      "Elvenking's palace. Magic shut the gates, but \n",
      "he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. \n",
      "Companies of the Wood-elves, sometimes with \n",
      "the king at their head, would from time to time \n",
      "ride out to hunt, or to other business in the \n",
      "woods and in the lands to the East. Then if \n",
      "Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just \n",
      "behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to \n",
      "do. More than once he was nearly caught in the \n",
      "doors, as they clashed together when the last \n",
      "elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among \n",
      "them because of his shadow (altogether thin \n",
      "and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of \n",
      "being bumped into and discovered. And when \n",
      "he did go out, which was not very often, he did \n",
      "no good. Fie did not wish to desert the dwarves, \n",
      "and indeed he did not know where in the world \n",
      "to go without them. He could not keep up with \n",
      "the hunting elves all the time they were out, so \n",
      "he never discovered the ways out of the wood, \n",
      "and was left to wander miserably in the forest, \n",
      "terrified of losing himself, until a chance came \n",
      "of returning. He was hungry too outside, for he \n",
      "was no hunter; but inside the caves he could \n",
      "pick up a living of some sort by stealing food \n",
      "from store or table when no one was at hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am like a burglar that can’t get away, but \n",
      "must go on miserably burgling the same house \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "day after day,” he thought. “This is the dreariest \n",
      "and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, \n",
      "uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in \n",
      "my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with \n",
      "the lamp shining!” He often wished, too, that he \n",
      "could get a message for help sent to the wizard, \n",
      "but that of course was quite impossible; and he \n",
      "soon realized that if anything was to be done, it \n",
      "would have to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone \n",
      "and unaided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, after a week or two of this \n",
      "sneaking sort of life, by watching and following \n",
      "the guards and taking what chances he could, \n",
      "he managed to find out where each dwarf was \n",
      "kept. He found all their twelve cells in different \n",
      "parts of the palace, and after a time he got to \n",
      "know his way about very well. What was his \n",
      "surprise one day to overhear some of the \n",
      "guards talking and to learn that there was \n",
      "another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep \n",
      "dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that \n",
      "that was Thorin; and after a while he found that \n",
      "his guess was right. At last after many \n",
      "difficulties he managed to find the place when \n",
      "no one was about, and to have a word with the \n",
      "chief of the dwarves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thorin was too wretched to be angry any \n",
      "longer at his misfortunes, and was even \n",
      "beginning to think of telling the king all about his \n",
      "treasure and his quest (which shows how low- \n",
      "spirited he had become), when he heard \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo’s little voice at his keyhole. He could \n",
      "hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made \n",
      "up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and \n",
      "he came to the door and had a long whispered \n",
      "talk with the hobbit on the other side. \n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that Bilbo was able to take \n",
      "secretly Thorin's message to each of the other \n",
      "imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin \n",
      "their chief was also in prison close at hand, and \n",
      "that no one was to reveal their errand to the \n",
      "king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. \n",
      "For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how \n",
      "the hobbit had rescued his companions from \n",
      "the spiders, and was determined once more \n",
      "not to ransom himself with promises to the king \n",
      "of a share in the treasure, until all hope of \n",
      "escaping in any other way had disappeared; \n",
      "until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins \n",
      "(of whom he began to have a very high opinion \n",
      "indeed) had altogether failed to think of \n",
      "something clever. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other dwarves quite agreed when they \n",
      "got the message. They all thought their own \n",
      "shares in the treasure (which they quite \n",
      "regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and \n",
      "the still unconquered dragon) would suffer \n",
      "seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, \n",
      "and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had \n",
      "said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was \n",
      "part of his reason for going off and leaving \n",
      "them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so \n",
      "hopeful as they did. He did not like being \n",
      "depended on by everyone, and he wished he \n",
      "had the wizard at hand. But that was no use: \n",
      "probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay \n",
      "between them. He sat and thought and thought, \n",
      "until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea \n",
      "would come. One invisible ring was a very fine \n",
      "thing, but it was not much good among fourteen. \n",
      "But of course, as you have guessed, he did \n",
      "rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it \n",
      "happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day, nosing and wandering about, \n",
      "Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the \n",
      "great gates were not the only entrance to the \n",
      "caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest \n",
      "regions of the palace, and joined the Forest \n",
      "River some way further to the east, beyond the \n",
      "steep slope out of which the main mouth \n",
      "opened. Where this underground watercourse \n",
      "came forth from the hillside there was a water- \n",
      "gate. There the rocky roof came down close to \n",
      "the surface of the stream, and from it a \n",
      "portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of \n",
      "the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that \n",
      "way. But the portcullis was often open, for a \n",
      "good deal of traffic went out and in by the water- \n",
      "gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would \n",
      "have found himself in a dark rough tunnel \n",
      "leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one \n",
      "point where it passed under the caves the roof \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "had been cut away and covered with great \n",
      "oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into \n",
      "the king’s cellars. There stood barrels, and \n",
      "barrels, and barrels; for the Wood-elves, and \n",
      "especially their king, were very fond of wine, \n",
      "though no vines grew in those parts. The wine, \n",
      "and other goods, were brought from far away, \n",
      "from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the \n",
      "vineyards of Men in distant lands. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hiding behind one of the largest barrels \n",
      "Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, \n",
      "and lurking there, listening to the talk of the \n",
      "king's servants, he learned how the wine and \n",
      "other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to \n",
      "the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still \n",
      "throve there, built out on bridges far into the \n",
      "water as a protection against enemies of all \n",
      "sorts, and especially against the dragon of the \n",
      "Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were \n",
      "brought up the Forest River. Often they were \n",
      "just tied together like big rafts and poled or \n",
      "rowed up the stream; sometimes they were \n",
      "loaded on to flat boats. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the barrels were empty the elves cast \n",
      "them through the trapdoors, opened the water- \n",
      "gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, \n",
      "bobbing along, until they were carried by the \n",
      "current to a place far down the river where the \n",
      "bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of \n",
      "Mirkwood. There they were collected and tied \n",
      "together and floated back to Lake-town, which \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stood close to the point where the Forest River \n",
      "flowed into the Long Lake. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this \n",
      "water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for \n",
      "the escape of his friends, and at last he had the \n",
      "desperate beginnings of a plan. \n",
      "\n",
      "The evening meal had been taken to the \n",
      "prisoners. The guards were tramping away \n",
      "down the passages taking the torchlight with \n",
      "them and leaving everything in darkness. Then \n",
      "Bilbo heard the king's butler bidding the chief of \n",
      "the guards good-night. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now come with me,” he said, “and taste \n",
      "the new wine that has just come in. I shall be \n",
      "hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the \n",
      "empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help \n",
      "the labour.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good,” laughed the chief of the \n",
      "guards. “I’ll taste with you, and see if it is fit for \n",
      "the king’s table. There is a feast tonight and it \n",
      "would not do to send up poor stuff!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for \n",
      "he saw that luck was with him and he had a \n",
      "chance at once to try his desperate plan. Fie \n",
      "followed the two elves, until they entered a small \n",
      "cellar and sat down at a table on which two \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "large flagons were set. Soon they began to \n",
      "drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual kind \n",
      "was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to \n",
      "make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would \n",
      "seem, was the heady vintage of the great \n",
      "gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his \n",
      "soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts \n",
      "only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler’s \n",
      "great flagons. \n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, \n",
      "then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep. \n",
      "The butler went on talking and laughing to \n",
      "himself for a while without seeming to notice, \n",
      "but soon his head too nodded to the table, and \n",
      "he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. \n",
      "Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon the chief \n",
      "guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as \n",
      "fast as he could along the passages towards \n",
      "the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy \n",
      "to his arms, and his heart was often in his \n",
      "mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not \n",
      "prevent the keys from making every now and \n",
      "then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in \n",
      "a tremble. \n",
      "\n",
      "First he unlocked Balin’s door, and locked it \n",
      "again carefully as soon as the dwarf was \n",
      "outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can \n",
      "imagine; but glad as he was to get out of his \n",
      "wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop \n",
      "and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was \n",
      "going to do, and all about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“No time now!” said the hobbit. “You just \n",
      "follow me! We must all keep together and not \n",
      "risk getting separated. All of us must escape or \n",
      "none, and this is our last chance. If this is found \n",
      "out, goodness knows where the king will put you \n",
      "next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I \n",
      "expect. Don't argue, there’s a good fellow!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then off he went from door to door, until his \n",
      "following had grown to twelve — none of them \n",
      "any too nimble, what with the dark, and what \n",
      "with their long imprisonment. Bilbo’s heart \n",
      "thumped every time one of them bumped into \n",
      "another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. \n",
      "“Drat this dwarvish racket!” he said to himself. \n",
      "But all went well, and they met no guards. As a \n",
      "matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in \n",
      "the woods that night, and in the halls above. \n",
      "Nearly all the king’s folk were merrymaking. \n",
      "\n",
      "At last after much blundering they came to \n",
      "Thorin’s dungeon, far down in a deep place and \n",
      "fortunately not far from the cellars. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo \n",
      "whispered to him to come out and join his \n",
      "friends, “Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty \n",
      "fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time \n",
      "comes. I am sure we are all for ever at your \n",
      "service, whatever happens after this. But what \n",
      "comes next?” \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain \n",
      "his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel \n",
      "at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "fears were quite justified, for they did not like it \n",
      "a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of \n",
      "their danger. \n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall be bruised and battered to \n",
      "pieces, and drowned too, for certain!” they \n",
      "muttered. “We thought you had got some \n",
      "sensible notion, when you managed to get hold \n",
      "of the keys. This is a mad idea!” \n",

      "up in barrels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon a grey patch came in the \n",

      "water-gate being hauled up, and he found that \n",
      "he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping \n",
      "mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to \n",
      "pass under the arch and get out into the open \n",
      "stream. He had as much as he could do to \n",
      "prevent himself from being hustled and battered \n",
      "to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to \n",
      "break up and swing off, one by one, under the \n",
      "stony arch and away Then he saw that it would \n",
      "have been no good even if he had managed to \n",
      "get astride his barrel, for there was no room to \n",
      "spare, not even for a hobbit, between its top \n",
      "and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate \n",
      "was. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Out they went under the overhanging branches \n",
      "of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered \n",
      "what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot \n",
      "of water was getting into their tubs. Some of \n",
      "those that bobbed along by him in the gloom \n",
      "seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed \n",
      "that these had dwarves inside. \n",

      "“I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!” he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought, but before long he was worrying too \n",
      "much about himself to remember the dwarves. \n",
      "He managed to keep his head above the water, \n",
      "but he was shivering with the cold, and he \n",
      "wondered if he would die of it before the luck \n",
      "turned, and how much longer he would be able \n",
      "to hang on, and whether he should risk the \n",
      "chance of letting go and trying to swim to the \n",
      "bank. \n",
      "\n",
      "The luck turned all right before long: the \n",
      "eddying current carried several barrels close \n",
      "ashore at one point and there for a while they \n",
      "stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo \n",
      "took the opportunity of scrambling up the side \n",
      "of his barrel while it was held steady against \n",
      "another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, and \n",
      "lay on the top spread out to keep the balance \n",
      "as best he could. The breeze was cold but \n",
      "better than the water, and he hoped he would \n",
      "not suddenly roll off again when they started off \n",
      "once more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before long the barrels broke free again \n",
      "and turned and twisted off down the stream, \n",
      "and out into the main current. Then he found it \n",
      "quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; \n",
      "but he managed it somehow, though it was \n",
      "miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very \n",
      "light, and the barrel was a good big one and \n",
      "being rather leaky had now shipped a small \n",
      "amount of water. All the same it was like trying \n",
      "to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a \n",
      "place where the trees on either hand grew \n",
      "thinner. He could see the paler sky between \n",
      "them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, \n",
      "and there it was joined to the main water of the \n",
      "Forest River flowing down in haste from the \n",
      "king's great doors. There was a dim sheet of \n",
      "water no longer overshadowed, and on its \n",
      "sliding surface there were dancing and broken \n",
      "reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the \n",
      "hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the \n",
      "company of casks and tubs away to the north \n",
      "bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This \n",
      "had a shingly shore under hanging banks and \n",
      "was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting \n",
      "cape of hard rock. On the shallow shore most of \n",
      "the barrels ran aground, though a few went on \n",
      "to bump against the stony pier. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were people on the look-out on the \n",
      "banks. They quickly poled and pushed all the \n",
      "barrels together into the shallows, and when \n",
      "they had counted them they roped them \n",
      "together and left them till the morning. Poor \n",
      "dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. He \n",
      "slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and \n",
      "then sneaked along to some huts that he could \n",
      "see near the water’s edge. He no longer \n",
      "thought twice about picking up a supper \n",
      "uninvited if he got the chance, he had been \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now \n",
      "only too well what it was to be really hungry, not \n",
      "merely politely interested in the dainties of a \n",
      "well-filled larder. Also he had caught a glimpse \n",
      "of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to \n",
      "him with his dripping and ragged clothes \n",
      "clinging to him cold and clammy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no need to tell you much of his \n",

      "near the end of the eastward journey and \n",
      "coming to the last and greatest adventure, so \n",
      "we must hurry on. Of course helped by his \n",
      "magic ring he got on very well at first, but he \n",
      "was given away in the end by his wet footsteps \n",
      "and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he \n",
      "went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and \n",
      "wherever he tried to hide he was found out by \n",
      "the terrific explosions of his suppressed \n",
      "sneezes. Very soon there was a fine \n",
      "commotion in the village by the riverside; but \n",
      "Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf \n",
      "and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did \n",
      "not belong to him. The rest of the night he had \n",
      "to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but \n",
      "the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually \n",
      "dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though \n",
      "the yearwas getting late and the airwas chilly. \n",
      "\n",
      "He woke again with a specially loud \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there \n",
      "was a merry racket down by the river. They \n",
      "were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft- \n",
      "elves would soon be steering it off down the \n",
      "stream to Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He \n",
      "was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over. \n",
      "He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs \n",
      "would take him and managed just in time to get \n",
      "on to the mass of casks without being noticed \n",
      "in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun \n",
      "at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for \n",
      "a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good \n",
      "while. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a mighty pushing of poles. The \n",

      "“No time now!” cried the raftman. “Shove \n",

      "bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The \n",
      "shores sank. The trees ended. Then Bilbo saw \n",
      "a sight: \n",
      "\n",
      "The lands opened wide about him, filled \n",
      "with the waters of the river which broke up and \n",
      "wandered in a hundred winding courses, or \n",
      "halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles \n",
      "on every side; but still a strong water flowed on \n",
      "steadily through the midst. And far away, its \n",
      "dark head in a torn cloud, there loomed the \n",
      "Mountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North- \n",
      "East and the tumbled land that joined it to them \n",
      "could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked \n",
      "across the marshes to the forest. The Lonely \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through \n",
      "many adventures to see it, and now he did not \n",
      "like the look of it in the least. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he listened to the talk of the raftmen and \n",
      "pieced together the scraps of information they \n",
      "let fall, he soon realized that he was very \n",
      "fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from \n",
      "this distance. Dreary as had been his \n",
      "imprisonment and unpleasant as was his \n",
      "position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves \n",
      "underneath him) still, he had been more lucky \n",
      "than he had guessed. The talk was all of the \n",
      "trade that came and went on the waterways and \n",
      "the growth of the traffic on the river, as the \n",
      "roads out of the East towards Mirkwood \n",
      "vanished or fell into disuse; and of the \n",
      "bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood- \n",
      "elves about the upkeep of the Forest River and \n",
      "the care of the banks. Those lands had \n",
      "changed much since the days when dwarves \n",
      "dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people \n",
      "now remembered only as a very shadowy \n",
      "tradition. They had changed even in recent \n",
      "years, and since the last news that Gandalf had \n",
      "had of them. Great floods and rains had swollen \n",
      "the waters that flowed east; and there had been \n",
      "an earthquake or two (which some were \n",
      "inclined to attribute to the dragon — alluding to \n",
      "him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and \n",
      "bogs had spread wider and wider on either \n",
      "side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and \n",
      "wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost \n",
      "ways across. The elf-road through the wood \n",
      "which the dwarves had followed on the advice \n",
      "of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used \n",
      "end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the \n",
      "river offered any longer a safe way from the \n",
      "skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain- \n",
      "shadowed plains beyond, and the river was \n",
      "guarded by the Wood-elves’ king. \n",
      "\n",
      "So you see Bilbo had come in the end by \n",
      "the only road that was any good. It might have \n",
      "been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on \n",
      "the barrels, if he had known that news of this \n",
      "had reached Gandalf far away and given him \n",
      "great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing \n",
      "his other business (which does not come into \n",
      "this tale) and getting ready to come in search of \n",
      "Thorin’s company. But Bilbo did not know it. \n",
      "\n",
      "All he knew was that the river seemed to go \n",
      "on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, \n",
      "and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not \n",
      "like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at \n",
      "him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. \n",
      "After a while, however, the river took a more \n",
      "southerly course and the Mountain receded \n",
      "again, and at last, late in the day the shores \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "grew rocky, the river gathered all its wandering \n",
      "waters together into a deep and rapid flood, \n",
      "and they swept along at great speed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had set when turning with another \n",
      "sweep towards the East the forest-river rushed \n",
      "into the Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth \n",
      "with stony clifflike gates at either side whose \n",
      "feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! \n",
      "Bilbo had never imagined that any water that \n",
      "was not the sea could look so big. It was so \n",
      "wide that the opposite shores looked small and \n",
      "far, but it was so long that its northerly end, \n",
      "which pointed towards the Mountain, could not \n",
      "be seen at all. Only from the map did Bilbo \n",
      "know that away up there, where the stars of the \n",
      "Wain were already twinkling, the Running River \n",
      "came down into the lake from Dale and with the \n",
      "Forest River filled with deep waters what must \n",
      "once have been a great deep rocky valley. At \n",
      "the southern end the doubled waters poured out \n",
      "again over high waterfalls and ran away \n",
      "hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still evening \n",
      "air the noise of the falls could be heard like a \n",
      "distant roar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from the mouth of the Forest River \n",
      "was the strange town he heard the elves speak \n",
      "of in the king’s cellars. It was not built on the \n",
      "shore, though there were a few huts and \n",
      "buildings there, but right out on the surface of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering \n",
      "river by a promontory of rock which formed a \n",
      "calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out \n",
      "to where on huge piles made of forest trees \n",
      "was built a busy wooden town, not a town of \n",
      "elves but of Men, who still dared to dwell here \n",
      "under the shadow of the distant dragon- \n",
      "mountain. They still throve on the trade that \n",
      "came up the great river from the South and was \n",
      "carted past the falls to their town; but in the \n",
      "great days of old, when Dale in the North was \n",
      "rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and \n",
      "powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on \n",
      "the waters, and some were filled with gold and \n",
      "some with warriors in armour, and there had \n",
      "been wars and deeds which were now only a \n",
      "legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could \n",
      "still be seen along the shores when the waters \n",
      "sank in a drought. \n",
      "\n",
      "But men remembered little of all that, though \n",
      "some still sang old songs of the dwarf-kings of \n",
      "the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of \n",
      "Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the \n",
      "fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that \n",
      "Thror and Thrain would come back one day and \n",
      "gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain- \n",
      "gates, and all that land would be filled with new \n",
      "song and new laughter. But this pleasant legend \n",
      "did not much affect their daily business. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight \n",
      "boats rowed out from the piles of the town, and \n",
      "voices hailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were \n",
      "cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft \n",
      "was drawn out of the current of the Forest River \n",
      "and towed away round the high shoulder of rock \n",
      "into the little bay of Lake-town. There it was \n",
      "moored not far from the shoreward head of the \n",
      "great bridge. Soon men would come up from \n",
      "the South and take some of the casks away, \n",
      "and others they would fill with goods they had \n",
      "brought to be taken back up the stream to the \n",
      "Wood-elves’ home. In the meanwhile the \n",
      "barrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft \n",
      "and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town. \n",
      "\n",
      "They would have been surprised, if they \n",
      "could have seen what happened down by the \n",
      "shore, after they had gone and the shades of \n",
      "night had fallen. First of all a barrel was cut \n",
      "loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and \n",
      "opened. Groans came from inside, and out \n",
      "crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet straw was in \n",
      "his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so \n",
      "bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stumble through the shallow water to lie \n",
      "groaning on the shore. He had a famished and \n",
      "a savage look like a dog that has been chained \n",
      "and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was \n",
      "Thorin, but you could only have told it by his \n",
      "golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty \n",
      "and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished \n",
      "silver tassel. It was some time before he would \n",
      "be even polite to the hobbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, are you alive or are you dead?” \n",
      "asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps he had \n",
      "forgotten that he had had at least one good \n",
      "meal more than the dwarves, and also the use \n",
      "of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater \n",
      "allowance of air. “Are you still in prison, or are \n",
      "you free? If you want food, and if you want to go \n",
      "on with this silly adventure — it’s yours after all \n",
      "and not mine — you had better slap your arms \n",
      "and rub your legs and try and help me get the \n",
      "others out while there is a chance!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so \n",
      "after a few more groans he got up and helped \n",
      "the hobbit as well as he could. In the darkness \n",
      "floundering in the cold water they had a difficult \n",
      "and very nasty job finding which were the right \n",
      "barrels. Knocking outside and calling only \n",
      "discovered about six dwarves that could \n",
      "answer. These were unpacked and helped \n",
      "ashore where they sat or lay muttering and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and \n",
      "cramped that they could hardly yet realize their \n",
      "release or be properly thankful for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dwalin and Balin were two of the most \n",
      "unhappy, and it was no good asking them to \n",
      "help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about \n",
      "and drier, but they lay down and would do \n",
      "nothing. Fili and Kili, however, who were young \n",
      "(for dwarves) and had also been packed more \n",
      "neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks, \n",
      "came out more or less smiling, with only a \n",
      "bruise or two and a stiffness that soon wore off. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope I never smell the smell of apples \n",
      "again!” said Fili. “My tub was full of it. To smell \n",
      "apples everlastingly when you can scarcely \n",
      "move and are cold and sick with hunger is \n",
      "maddening. I could eat anything in the wide \n",

      "\n",
      "With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin \n",
      "and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of \n",
      "the company and got them out. Poor fat \n",
      "Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, \n",
      "Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and \n",
      "seemed only half alive; they all had to be \n",
      "carried one by one and laid helpless on the \n",
      "shore. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Here we are!” said Thorin. “And I \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "though I wish he could have arranged a more \n",
      "comfortable journey. Still — all very much at your \n",
      "service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we \n",
      "shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and \n",
      "recovered. In the meanwhile what next?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I suggest Lake-town,” said Bilbo. “What \n",
      "else is there?” \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing else could, of course, be \n",
      "suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili \n",
      "and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to \n",
      "the great bridge. There were guards at the \n",
      "head of it, but they were not keeping very \n",
      "careful watch, for it was so long since there had \n",
      "been any real need. Except for occasional \n",
      "squabbles about river-tolls they were friends \n",
      "with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far away; \n",
      "and some of the younger people in the town \n",
      "openly doubted the existence of any dragon in \n",
      "the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards \n",
      "and gammers who said that they had seen him \n",
      "flying in the sky in their young days. That being \n",
      "so it is not surprising that the guards were \n",
      "drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and \n",
      "did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the \n",
      "dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. \n",
      "Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin \n",
      "Oakenshield stepped in through the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you and what do you want?” they \n",
      "shouted leaping to their feet and groping for \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weapons. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King \n",
      "under the Mountain!” said the dwarf in a loud \n",
      "voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn \n",
      "clothes and draggled hood. The gold gleamed \n",
      "on his neck and waist; his eyes were dark and \n",
      "deep. “I have come back. I wish to see the \n",
      "Master of your town! ” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was tremendous excitement. \n",
      "Some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if \n",
      "they expected the Mountain to go golden in the \n",
      "night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow \n",
      "right away. The captain of the guard came \n",
      "forward. \n",

      "Fili and Kili and Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“If you come in peace lay down your arms!” \n",
      "said the captain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“We have none,” said Thorin, and it was \n",
      "true enough: their knives had been taken from \n",
      "them by the wood-elves, and the great sword \n",
      "Orcrist too. Bilbo had his short sword, hidden \n",
      "as usual, but he said nothing about that. “We \n",
      "have no need of weapons, who return at last to \n",
      "our own as spoken of old. Nor could we fight \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Then all the more reason for taking us to \n",
      "him,” burst in Fili, who was getting impatient at \n",
      "these solemnities. “We are worn and famished \n",
      "after our long road and we have sick comrades. \n",
      "Now make haste and let us have no more \n",

      "six men about them he led them over the bridge \n",
      "through the gates and into the market-place of \n",
      "the town. This was a wide circle of quiet water \n",
      "surrounded by the tall piles on which were built \n",
      "the greater houses, and by long wooden quays \n",
      "with many steps and ladders going down to the \n",
      "surface of the lake. From one great hall shone \n",
      "many lights and there came the sound of many \n",
      "voices. They passed its doors and stood \n",
      "blinking in the light looking at long tables filled \n",
      "with folk. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King \n",
      "under the Mountain! I return!” cried Thorin in a \n",
      "loud voice from the door, before the captain \n",
      "could say anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "All leaped to their feet. The Master of the \n",
      "town sprang from his great chair. But none rose \n",
      "in greater surprise than the raft-men of the elves \n",
      "who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressing forward before the Master’s table they \n",

      "sneaking through the woods and molesting our \n",
      "people!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this true?” asked the Master. As a matter \n",
      "of fact he thought it far more likely than the \n",
      "return of the King under the Mountain, if any \n",
      "such person had ever existed. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by \n",
      "the Elvenking and imprisoned without cause as \n",
      "we journeyed back to our own land,” answered \n",
      "Thorin. “But lock nor bar may hinder the \n",

      "men of the king.” \n",

      "old songs, giving his mind to trade and tolls, to \n",
      "cargoes and gold, to which habit he owed his \n",
      "position. Others were of different mind, \n",
      "however, and quickly the matter was settled \n",
      "without him. The news had spread from the \n",
      "doors of the hall like fire through all the town. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "People were shouting inside the hall and \n",
      "outside it. The quays were thronged with \n",
      "hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of \n",
      "old songs concerning the return of the King \n",
      "under the Mountain; that it was Thror’s \n",
      "grandson not Thror himself that had come back \n",
      "did not bother them at all. Others took up the \n",

      "was a great deal more of it, and there was \n",
      "much shouting as well as the music of harps \n",
      "and of fiddles mixed up with it. Indeed such \n",
      "excitement had not been known in the town in \n",
      "the memory of the oldest grandfather. The \n",
      "Wood-elves themselves began to wonder \n",
      "greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know \n",
      "of course how Thorin had escaped, and they \n",
      "began to think their king might have made a \n",
      "serious mistake. As for the Master he saw there \n",
      "was nothing else for it but to obey the general \n",
      "clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to \n",
      "pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. \n",
      "So he gave up to him his own great chair and \n",
      "set Fili and Kili beside him in places of honour. \n",
      "Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, \n",
      "and no explanation of where he came in — no \n",
      "songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest \n",
      "way — was asked for in the general bustle. \n",

      "Soon afterwards the other dwarves were \n",
      "brought into the town amid scenes of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored \n",
      "and fed and housed and pampered in the most \n",
      "delightful and satisfactory fashion. A large \n",
      "house was given up to Thorin and his company; \n",
      "boats and rowers were put at their service; and \n",
      "crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or \n",
      "cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his \n",

      "\n",
      "Some of the songs were old ones; but \n",
      "some of them were quite new and spoke \n",
      "confidently of the sudden death of the dragon \n",
      "and of cargoes of rich presents coming down \n",
      "the river to Lake-town. These were inspired \n",
      "largely by the Master and they did not \n",
      "particularly please the dwarves, but in the \n",
      "meantime they were well contented and they \n",
      "quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within \n",
      "a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in \n",
      "fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards \n",
      "combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin \n",
      "looked and walked as if his kingdom was \n",
      "already regained and Smaug chopped up into \n",
      "little pieces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as he had said, the dwarves’ good \n",
      "feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger \n",
      "every day. There were no more groans or \n",
      "grumbles. They drank his health, and they \n",
      "patted him on the back, and they made a great \n",
      "fuss of him; which was just as well, for he was \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not \n",
      "forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the \n",
      "thought of the dragon, and he had besides a \n",
      "shocking cold. For three days he sneezed and \n",
      "coughed, and he could not go out, and even \n",
      "after that his speeches at banquets were \n",
      "limited to “Thag you very buch.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone \n",
      "back up the Forest River with their cargoes, \n",
      "and there was great excitement in the king’s \n",
      "palace. I have never heard what happened to \n",
      "the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of \n",
      "course was ever said about keys or barrels \n",
      "while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and \n",
      "Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. \n",
      "Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was \n",
      "known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained \n",
      "a bit of a mystery. In any case the king knew \n",
      "now the dwarves’ errand, or thought he did, and \n",
      "he said to himself: \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well! We’ll see! No treasure will come \n",
      "back through Mirkwood without my having \n",
      "something to say in the matter. But I expect they \n",
      "will all come to a bad end, and serve them \n",
      "right!” He at any rate did not believe in dwarves \n",
      "fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "strongly suspected attempted burglary or \n",
      "something like it — which shows he was a wise \n",
      "elf and wiser than the men of the town, though \n",
      "not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He \n",
      "sent out his spies about the shores of the lake \n",
      "and as far northward towards the Mountain as \n",
      "they would go, and waited. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to \n",
      "think of departure. While the enthusiasm still \n",
      "lasted in the town was the time to get help. It \n",
      "would not do to let everything cool down with \n",
      "delay. So he spoke to the Master and his \n",
      "\n",
      "councillors and said that soon he and his \n",
      "\n",
      "company must go on towards the Mountain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then for the first time the Master was \n",
      "surprised and a little frightened; and he \n",
      "\n",
      "wondered if Thorin was after all really a \n",
      "\n",
      "descendant of the old kings. He had never \n",
      "thought that the dwarves would actually dare to \n",
      "approach Smaug, but believed they were \n",
      "frauds who would sooner or later be discovered \n",
      "and be turned out. He was wrong. Thorin, of \n",
      "course, was really the grandson of the King \n",
      "under the Mountain, and there is no knowing \n",
      "what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or \n",
      "the recovery of his own. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Master was not sorry at all to let \n",
      "them go. They were expensive to keep, and \n",
      "their arrival had turned things into a long holiday \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in which business was at a standstill. “Let them \n",
      "go and bother Smaug, and see how he \n",
      "welcomes them!” he thought. “Certainly, O \n",
      "Thorin Thrain’s son Thror’s son!” was what he \n",
      "said. “You must claim your own. The hour is at \n",
      "hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer \n",
      "shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude \n",
      "when your kingdom is regained.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So one day, although autumn was now \n",
      "getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves \n",
      "were falling fast, three large boats left Lake- \n",
      "town, laden with rowers, dwarves, Mr. Baggins, \n",
      "and many provisions. Horses and ponies had \n",
      "been sent round by circuitous paths to meet \n",
      "them at their appointed landing-place. The \n",
      "Master and his councillors bade them farewell \n",
      "from the great steps of the town-hall that went \n",
      "down to the lake. People sang on the quays \n",
      "and out of windows. The white oars dipped and \n",
      "splashed, and off they went north up the lake on \n",
      "the last stage of their long journey. The only \n",
      "person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo. \n",

      "In two days going they rowed right up the Long \n",

      "and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain \n",
      "towering grim and tall before them. The stream \n",
      "was strong and their going slow. At the end of \n",
      "the third day, some miles up the river, they drew \n",
      "in to the left or western bank and disembarked. \n",
      "Here they were joined by the horses with other \n",
      "provisions and necessaries and the ponies for \n",
      "their own use that had been sent to meet them. \n",
      "They packed what they could on the ponies and \n",
      "the rest was made into a store under a tent, but \n",
      "none of the men of the town would stay with \n",
      "them even for the night so near the shadow of \n",
      "the Mountain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at any rate until the songs have come \n",
      "true!” said they. It was easier to believe in the \n",
      "Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in \n",
      "these wild parts. Indeed their stores had no \n",
      "need of any guard, for all the land was desolate \n",
      "and empty. So their escort left them, making off \n",
      "swiftly down the river and the shoreward paths, \n",
      "although the night was already drawing on. \n",
      "\n",
      "They spent a cold and lonely night and their \n",
      "spirits fell. The next day they set out again. Balin \n",
      "and Bilbo rode behind, each leading another \n",
      "pony heavily laden beside him; the others were \n",
      "some way ahead picking out a slow road, for \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "there were no paths. They made north-west, \n",
      "slanting away from the River Running, and \n",
      "drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur \n",
      "of the Mountain that was flung out southwards \n",
      "towards them. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a weary journey, and a quiet and \n",
      "stealthy one. There was no laughter or song or \n",
      "sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which \n",
      "had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old \n",
      "songs by the lake died away to a plodding \n",
      "gloom. They knew that they were drawing near \n",
      "to the end of their journey, and that it might be a \n",
      "very horrible end. The land about them grew \n",
      "bleak and barren, though once, as Thorin told \n",
      "them, it had been green and fair. There was \n",
      "little grass, and before long there was neither \n",
      "bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened \n",
      "stumps to speak of ones long vanished. They \n",
      "were come to the Desolation of the Dragon, \n",
      "and they were come at the waning of the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the \n",
      "same without meeting any danger or any sign of \n",
      "the Dragon other than the wilderness he had \n",
      "made about his lair. The Mountain lay dark and \n",
      "silent before them and ever higher above them. \n",
      "They made their first camp on the western side \n",
      "of the great southern spur, which ended in a \n",
      "height called Ravenhill. On this there had been \n",
      "an old watch-post; but they dared not climb it \n",
      "yet, it was too exposed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before setting out to search the western \n",
      "spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on \n",
      "which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a \n",

      "South where the Front Gate stood. For this \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and \n",
      "with them went Bilbo. They marched under the \n",
      "grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. \n",
      "There the river, after winding a wide loop over \n",
      "the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on \n",
      "its road to the Lake, flowing swift and noisily. Its \n",
      "bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above \n",
      "the stream; and gazing out from it over the \n",
      "narrow water, foaming and splashing among \n",
      "many boulders, they could see in the wide valley \n",
      "shadowed by the Mountain’s arms the grey \n",
      "ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There lies all that is left of Dale,” said Balin. \n",
      "“The mountain’s sides were green with woods \n",
      "and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in \n",
      "the days when the bells rang in that town.” He \n",
      "looked both sad and grim as he said this: he \n",
      "had been one of Thorin’s companions on the \n",
      "day the Dragon came. \n",
      "\n",
      "They did not dare to follow the river much \n",
      "further towards the Gate; but they went on \n",
      "beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying \n",
      "hidden behind a rock they could look out and \n",
      "see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff- \n",
      "wall between the arms of the Mountain. Out of it \n",
      "the waters of the Running River sprang; and out \n",
      "of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. \n",
      "Nothing moved in the waste, save the vapour \n",
      "and the water, and every now and again a black \n",
      "and ominous crow. The only sound was the \n",
      "sound of the stony water, and every now and \n",
      "again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin \n",
      "shuddered. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us return!” he said. “We can do no \n",
      "good here! And I don’t like these dark birds, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That does not prove it,” said Balin, “though \n",
      "I don’t doubt you are right. But he might be gone \n",
      "away some time, or he might be lying out on the \n",
      "mountain-side keeping watch, and still I expect \n",
      "smokes and steams would come out of the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by \n",

      "weary way back to the camp. Only in June they \n",
      "had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and \n",
      "though autumn was now crawling towards \n",
      "winter that pleasant time now seemed years \n",
      "ago. They were alone in the perilous waste \n",
      "without hope of further help. They were at the \n",
      "end of their journey, but as far as ever, it \n",
      "seemed, from the end of their quest. None of \n",
      "them had much spirit left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more \n",
      "than the others. He would often borrow Thorin's \n",
      "map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes \n",
      "and the message of the moon-letters Elrond \n",
      "had read. It was he that made the dwarves \n",
      "begin the dangerous search on the western \n",
      "slopes for the secret door. They moved their \n",
      "camp then to a long valley, narrower than the \n",
      "great dale in the South where the Gates of the \n",
      "river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the \n",
      "Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west \n",
      "from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges \n",
      "that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On \n",
      "this western side there were fewer signs of the \n",
      "dragon’s marauding feet, and there was some \n",
      "grass for their ponies. From this western camp, \n",
      "shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "began to sink towards the forest, day by day \n",
      "they toiled in parties searching for paths up the \n",
      "mountain-side, if the map was true, somewhere \n",
      "high above the cliff at the valley’s head must \n",
      "stand the secret door. Day by day they came \n",
      "back to their camp without success. \n",
      "\n",
      "But at last unexpectedly they found what \n",
      "they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit \n",
      "went back one day down the valley and \n",
      "scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its \n",
      "southern corner. About midday, creeping \n",
      "behind a great stone that stood alone like a \n",
      "pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough \n",
      "steps going upwards. Following these excitedly \n",
      "he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow \n",
      "track, often lost, often rediscovered, that \n",
      "wandered on to the top of the southern ridge \n",
      "and brought them at last to a still narrower \n",
      "ledge, which turned north across the face of the \n",
      "Mountain. Looking down they saw that they \n",
      "were at the top of the cliff at the valley’s head \n",
      "and were gazing down on to their own camp \n",
      "below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their \n",
      "right, they went in single file along the ledge, till \n",
      "the wall opened and they turned into a little \n",
      "steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. \n",
      "Its entrance which they had found could not be \n",
      "seen from below because of the overhang of \n",
      "the cliff, nor from further off because it was so \n",
      "small that it looked like a dark crack and no \n",
      "more. It was not a cave and was open to the sky \n",
      "above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up \n",
      "that in the lower part, close to the ground, was \n",
      "as smooth and upright as masons' work, but \n",
      "without a joint or crevice to be seen. No sign \n",
      "was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any \n",
      "sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not \n",
      "doubt that they had found the door at last. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, \n",
      "they implored it to move, they spoke fragments \n",
      "of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. \n",
      "At last tired out they rested on the grass at its \n",
      "feet, and then at evening began their long climb \n",
      "down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was excitement in the camp that night. In \n",
      "the morning they prepared to move once more. \n",
      "Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to \n",
      "guard the ponies and such stores as they had \n",
      "brought with them from the river. The others \n",
      "went down the valley and up the newly found \n",
      "path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along this \n",
      "they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow \n",
      "and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred \n",
      "and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks \n",
      "below; but each of them took a good coil of \n",
      "rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last \n",
      "without mishap they reached the little grassy \n",
      "bay. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they made their third camp, hauling \n",
      "up what they needed from below with their \n",
      "ropes. Down the same way they were able \n",
      "occasionally to lower one of the more active \n",
      "dwarves, such as Kili, to exchange such news \n",
      "as there was, or to take a share in the guard \n",
      "below, while Bofur was hauled up to the higher \n",
      "camp. Bombur would not come up either the \n",
      "rope or the path. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am too fat for such fly-walks,” he said. “I \n",
      "should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and \n",
      "then you would be thirteen again. And the \n",
      "knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.” \n",
      "Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile some of them explored the \n",
      "ledge beyond the opening and found a path that \n",
      "led higher and higher on to the mountain; but \n",
      "they did not dare to venture very far that way, \n",
      "nor was there much use in it. Out up there a \n",
      "silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound \n",
      "except that of the wind in the crannies of stone. \n",
      "They spoke low and never called or sang, for \n",
      "danger brooded in every rock. The others who \n",
      "were busy with the secret of the door had no \n",
      "more success. They were too eager to trouble \n",
      "about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried \n",
      "without resting to discover where exactly in the \n",
      "smooth face of the rock the door was hidden. \n",
      "They had brought picks and tools of many sorts \n",
      "from Lake-town, and at first they tried to use \n",

      "Mining work, they saw clearly, was no good \n",

      "opening the “doorstep” in fun, remembering \n",
      "Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party \n",
      "in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing \n",

      "over the wide lands to the black wall of \n",
      "Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in \n",

      "\n",

      "shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there \n",

      "“Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,” \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting — and “Good Gracious!” he thought, “so \n",

      "about the mountain-side. All day Bilbo sat \n",
      "gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone, \n",
      "or out west through the narrow opening. He had \n",
      "a queer feeling that he was waiting for \n",
      "something. “Perhaps the wizard will suddenly \n",
      "come back today,” he thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse \n",
      "of the distant forest. As the sun turned west \n",
      "there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as \n",
      "if the light caught the last pale leaves. Soon he \n",
      "saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards \n",
      "the level of his eyes. He went to the opening \n",
      "and there pale and faint was a thin new moon \n",
      "above the rim of Earth. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment he heard a sharp crack \n",
      "behind him. There on the grey stone in the \n",
      "grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal \n",
      "black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark \n",
      "spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was \n",
      "knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack! \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all \n",
      "danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the \n",
      "dwarves, shouting and waving. Those that were \n",
      "nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as \n",
      "fast as they could along the ledge to him, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wondering what on earth was the matter; the \n",
      "others shouted to be hauled up the ropes \n",
      "(except Bombur, of course: he was asleep). \n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: \n",
      "the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the \n",
      "dwarves with wagging beards watching \n",
      "impatiently. The sun sank lower and lower, and \n",
      "their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened \n",
      "cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, \n",
      "but still Bilbo stood almost without moving. The \n",
      "little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening \n",
      "was coming on. Then suddenly when their hope \n",
      "was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a \n",
      "finger through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of \n",
      "light came straight through the opening into the \n",
      "bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old \n",
      "thrush, who had been watching from a high \n",
      "perch with beady eyes and head cocked on \n",
      "one side, gave a sudden trill. There was a loud \n",
      "crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. \n",
      "A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from \n",
      "the ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly, trembling lest the chance should \n",
      "fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and \n",
      "pushed — in vain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The key! The key!\" cried Bilbo. “Where is \n",

      "\n",
      "Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key \n",
      "on its chain from round his neck. He put it to the \n",
      "hole. It fitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam \n",

      "evening sprang into the sky. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ahead down there?” he thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was. As he went forward it grew and grew, \n",
      "till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light \n",
      "steadily getting redder and redder. Also it was \n",
      "now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of \n",
      "vapour floated up and past him and he began to \n",
      "sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, \n",
      "a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot \n",
      "galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of \n",
      "a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the \n",

      "afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He \n",
      "fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before \n",
      "he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At \n",
      "any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you \n",
      "can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, \n",
      "an opening of much the same size and shape \n",
      "as the door above. Through it peeps the \n",
      "hobbit’s little head. Before him lies the great \n",
      "bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the \n",
      "ancient dwarves right at the Mountain’s root. It \n",
      "is almost dark so that its vastness can only be \n",

      "asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and \n",
      "nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were \n",
      "low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs \n",
      "and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all \n",
      "sides stretching away across the unseen floors, \n",
      "lay countless piles of precious things, gold \n",

      "silver red-stained in the ruddy light. \n",

      "long pale belly crusted with gems and \n",
      "fragments of gold from his long lying on his \n",
      "costly bed. Behind him where the walls were \n",
      "nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, \n",
      "helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; \n",
      "and there in rows stood great jars and vessels \n",
      "filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. \n",
      "\n",
      "To say that Bilbo’s breath was taken away \n",
      "is no description at all. There are no words left \n",
      "to express his staggerment, since Men \n",
      "changed the language that they learned of elves \n",
      "in the days when all the world was wonderful. \n",
      "Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of \n",
      "such treasure had never yet come home to him. \n",
      "His heart was filled and pierced with \n",
      "enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; \n",
      "and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the \n",
      "frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and \n",
      "count. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He gazed for what seemed an age, before \n",
      "drawn almost against his will, he stole from the \n",
      "shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the \n",
      "nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above \n",
      "him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace \n",
      "even in his sleep. He grasped a great two- \n",
      "handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and \n",
      "cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a \n",
      "wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring \n",
      "changed its note. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not \n",
      "wake — not yet — but shifted into other dreams of \n",
      "greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall \n",
      "while the little hobbit toiled back up the long \n",
      "tunnel. His heart was beating and a more \n",
      "fevered shaking was in his legs than when he \n",
      "was going down, but still he clutched the cup, \n",
      "and his chief thought was: “I’ve done it! This will \n",
      "show them. ‘More like a grocer than a burglar’ \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "indeed! Well, we’ll hear no more of that.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the \n",
      "hobbit again, and as delighted as he was \n",
      "surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him \n",
      "out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds \n",
      "had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his \n",
      "eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the \n",
      "feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing \n",
      "the excitement of the dwarves, or how they \n",
      "praised him and patted him on the back and put \n",
      "themselves and all their families for generations \n",
      "to come at his service. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves were still passing the cup from \n",
      "hand to hand and talking delightedly of the \n",
      "recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast \n",
      "rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if \n",
      "it was an old volcano that had made up its mind \n",
      "to start eruptions once again. The door behind \n",
      "them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from \n",
      "closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel \n",
      "came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the \n",
      "depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that \n",
      "made the ground beneath them tremble. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their \n",
      "confident boasts of a moment before and \n",
      "cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "reckoned with. It does not do to leave a live \n",

      "him. Dragons may not have much real use for \n",
      "all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a \n",
      "rule, especially after long possession; and \n",
      "Smaug was no exception. He had passed from \n",
      "an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether \n",
      "insignificant in size but provided with a bitter \n",
      "sword and great courage, figured most \n",
      "unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to \n",
      "wide waking. There was a breath of strange air \n",
      "in his cave. Could there be a draught from that \n",
      "little hole? He had never felt quite happy about \n",
      "it, though it was so small, and now he glared at \n",
      "it in suspicion and wondered why he had never \n",
      "blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied he had \n",
      "caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound \n",
      "from far above that came down through it to his \n",
      "lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to \n",
      "sniff. Then he missed the cup! \n",
      "\n",
      "Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not \n",
      "happened since first he came to the Mountain! \n",
      "His rage passes description — the sort of rage \n",
      "that is only seen when rich folk that have more \n",
      "than they can enjoy suddenly lose something \n",
      "that they have long had but have never before \n",
      "used or wanted. His fire belched forth, the hall \n",
      "smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust \n",
      "his head in vain at the little hole, and then \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "coiling his length together, roaring like thunder \n",
      "underground, he sped from his deep lair \n",
      "through its great door, out into the huge \n",
      "passages of the mountain-palace and up \n",
      "towards the Front Gate. \n",
      "\n",
      "To hunt the whole mountain till he had \n",
      "caught the thief and had torn and trampled him \n",
      "was his one thought. He issued from the Gate, \n",
      "the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and \n",
      "up he soared blazing into the air and settled on \n",
      "the mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet \n",
      "flame. The dwarves heard the awful rumour of \n",
      "his flight, and they crouched against the walls of \n",
      "the grassy terrace cringing under boulders, \n",
      "hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of \n",
      "the hunting dragon. \n",
      "\n",
      "There they would have all been killed, if it \n",
      "had not been for Bilbo once again. “Quick! \n",
      "Quick!” he gasped. “The door! The tunnel! It’s \n",
      "no good here.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Roused by these words they were just \n",
      "about to creep inside the tunnel when Bifur \n",
      "gave a cry: “My cousins! Bombur and Bofur — \n",
      "we have forgotten them, they are down in the \n",
      "valley!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“They will be slain, and all our ponies too, \n",
      "and all our stores lost,” moaned the others. “We \n",
      "can do nothing.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said Thorin, recovering his \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dignity. “We cannot leave them. Get inside Mr. \n",
      "Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili — \n",
      "the dragon shan’t have all of us. Now you \n",
      "others, where are the ropes? Be quick!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Those were perhaps the worst moments \n",
      "they had been through yet. The horrible sounds \n",
      "of Smaug’s anger were echoing in the stony \n",
      "hollows far above; at any moment he might \n",
      "come blazing down or fly whirling round and find \n",
      "them there, near the perilous cliffs edge hauling \n",
      "madly on the ropes. Up came Bofur, and still all \n",
      "was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and \n",
      "blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all \n",
      "was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of \n",
      "stores, and then danger was upon them. \n",
      "\n",
      "A whirring noise was heard. A red light \n",
      "touched the points of standing rocks. The \n",
      "dragon came. \n",
      "\n",
      "They had barely time to fly back to the \n",
      "tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, \n",
      "when Smaug came hurtling from the North, \n",
      "licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating \n",
      "his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind. \n",
      "His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the \n",
      "door, and drove in through the crack they had \n",
      "left and scorched them as they lay hid. \n",
      "Flickering fires leaped up and black rock- \n",
      "shadows danced. Then darkness fell as he \n",
      "passed again. The ponies screamed with \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. \n",
      "The dragon swooped and turned to pursue \n",
      "them, and was gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That’ll be the end of our poor beasts!” said \n",
      "Thorin. “Nothing can escape Smaug once he \n",
      "sees it. Here we are and here we shall have to \n",
      "stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long \n",
      "open miles back to the river with Smaug on the \n",
      "watch!” \n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a pleasant thought! They crept \n",
      "further down the tunnel, and there they lay and \n",
      "shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until \n",
      "dawn came pale through the crack of the door. \n",
      "Every now and again through the night they \n",
      "could hear the roar of the flying dragon grow \n",
      "and then pass and fade, as he hunted round \n",
      "and round the mountain-sides. \n",
      "\n",
      "He guessed from the ponies, and from the \n",
      "traces of the camps he had discovered, that \n",
      "men had come up from the river and the lake \n",
      "and had scaled the mountain-side from the \n",
      "valley where the ponies had been standing; but \n",
      "the door withstood his searching eye, and the \n",
      "little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest \n",
      "flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn \n",
      "chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden \n",
      "couch to sleep — and to gather new strength. He \n",
      "would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a \n",
      "thousand years turned him to smouldering \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and \n",
      "silent he crept back to his lair and half closed \n",
      "his eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "When morning came the terror of the \n",
      "dwarves grew less. They realized that dangers \n",
      "of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such \n",
      "a guardian, and that it was no good giving up \n",
      "their quest yet. Nor could they get away just \n",
      "now, as Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies \n",
      "were lost or killed, and they would have to wait \n",
      "some time before Smaug relaxed his watch \n",
      "sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot. \n",
      "Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to \n",
      "last them still for some time. \n",
      "\n",
      "They debated long on what was to be done, \n",
      "but they could think of no way of getting rid of \n",
      "Smaug — which had always been a weak point \n",
      "in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out. \n",
      "Then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly \n",
      "perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, \n",
      "blaming him for what had at first so pleased \n",
      "them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up \n",
      "Smaug’s wrath so soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What else do you suppose a burglar is to \n",
      "do?” asked Bilbo angrily. “I was not engaged to \n",
      "kill dragons, that is warrior’s work, but to steal \n",
      "treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did \n",
      "you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard \n",
      "of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "be done, I think I might have a say. You ought to \n",
      "have brought five hundred burglars not one. I \n",
      "am sure it reflects great credit on your \n",
      "grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you \n",
      "ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to \n",
      "me. I should want hundreds of years to bring it \n",
      "all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as \n",
      "tame as a rabbit.” \n",
      "\n",
      "After that of course the dwarves begged his \n",
      "pardon. “What then do you propose we should \n",
      "do, Mr. Baggins?” asked Thorin politely. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no idea at the moment — if you mean \n",
      "about removing the treasure. That obviously \n",
      "depends entirely on some new turn of luck and \n",
      "the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons \n",
      "is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to \n",
      "think about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, \n",
      "and wish I was safe back at home.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind that for the moment! What are \n",
      "we to do now, to-day?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if you really want my advice, I should \n",
      "say we can do nothing but stay where we are. \n",
      "By day we can no doubt creep out safely \n",
      "enough to take the air. Perhaps before long one \n",
      "or two could be chosen to go back to the store \n",
      "by the river and replenish our supplies. But in \n",
      "the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside \n",
      "the tunnel by night. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I will make you an offer. I have got my \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ring and will creep down this very noon — then if \n",
      "ever Smaug ought to be napping — and see \n",
      "what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn \n",
      "up. ‘Every worm has his weak spot,’ as my \n",
      "father used to say, though I am sure it was not \n",
      "from personal experience.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer \n",
      "eagerly. Already they had come to respect little \n",
      "Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in \n",
      "their adventure. He had begun to have ideas \n",
      "and plans of his own. When midday came he \n",
      "got ready for another journey down into the \n",
      "Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it was \n",
      "not so bad now he knew, more or less, what \n",
      "was in front of him. Had he known more about \n",
      "dragons and their wily ways, he might have \n",
      "been more frightened and less hopeful of \n",
      "catching this one napping. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was shining when he started, but it \n",
      "was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from \n",
      "the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went \n",
      "down. So silent was his going that smoke on a \n",
      "gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it, and \n",
      "he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as \n",
      "he drew near the lower door. There was only the \n",
      "veryfaintestglowto be seen. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Smaug is weary and asleep,” he \n",
      "thought. “He can’t see me and he won’t hear \n",
      "me. Cheer up Bilbo!” He had forgotten or had \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "never heard about dragons’ sense of smell. It is \n",
      "also an awkward fact that they can keep half an \n",
      "eye open watching while they sleep, if they are \n",
      "suspicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost \n",
      "dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than \n",
      "a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped \n",
      "once more from the entrance. He was just about \n",
      "to step out on to the floor when he caught a \n",
      "sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under \n",
      "the drooping lid of Smaug’s left eye. He was \n",
      "only pretending to sleep! He was watching the \n",
      "tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back \n",
      "and blessed the luck of his ring. Then Smaug \n",
      "spoke. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear \n",
      "your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, \n",
      "there is plenty and to spare!” \n",
      "\n",
      "But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in \n",
      "dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to \n",
      "get him to come nearer so easily he was \n",
      "disappointed. \"No thank you, O Smaug the \n",
      "Tremendous!” he replied. “I did not come for \n",
      "presents. I only wished to have a look at you \n",
      "and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I \n",
      "did not believe them.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you now?” said the dragon somewhat \n",
      "flattered, even thouqh he did not believe a word \n",
      "of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the \n",
      "reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of \n",
      "Calamities,” replied Bilbo. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You have nice manners for a thief and a \n",
      "liar,” said the dragon. “You seem familiar with \n",
      "my name, but I don’t seem to remember \n",
      "smelling you before. Who are you and where do \n",
      "you come from, may I ask?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“You may indeed! I come from under the hill, \n",
      "and under the hills and over the hills my paths \n",
      "led. And through the air. I am he that walks \n",
      "unseen.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“So I can well believe,” said Smaug, “but \n",
      "that is hardly your usual name.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the \n",
      "stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Lovely titles!” sneered the dragon. “But \n",
      "lucky numbers don’t always come off.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am he that buries his friends alive and \n",
      "drowns them and draws them alive again from \n",
      "the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no \n",
      "bag went over me.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed \n",
      "Smaug. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am the friend of bears and the guest of \n",
      "eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "am Barrel-rider,” went on Bilbo beginning to be \n",
      "pleased with his riddling. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s better!” said Smaug. “But don’t let \n",
      "your imagination run away with you!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if \n",
      "you don’t want to reveal your proper name \n",
      "(which is wise), and don’t want to infuriate them \n",
      "by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No \n",
      "dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk \n",
      "and of wasting time trying to understand it. \n",
      "There was a lot here which Smaug did not \n",
      "understand at all (though I expect you do, since \n",
      "you know all about Bilbo’s adventures to which \n",
      "he was referring), but he thought he understood \n",
      "enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought so last night,” he smiled to \n",
      "himself. “Lake-men, some nasty scheme of \n",
      "those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I’m a \n",
      "lizard. I haven’t been down that way for an age \n",
      "and an age; but I will soon alter that!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, O Barrel-rider!” he said aloud. \n",
      "“Maybe Barrel was your pony’s name; and \n",
      "maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may \n",
      "walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way. \n",
      "Let me tell you I ate six ponies last night and I \n",
      "shall catch and eat all the others before long. In \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "return for the excellent meal I will give you one \n",
      "piece of advice for your good: don’t have more \n",
      "to do with dwarves than you can help!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Dwarves!” said Bilbo in pretended \n",
      "surprise. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t talk to me!” said Smaug. “I know the \n",
      "smell (and taste) of dwarf — no one better. Don’t \n",
      "tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and \n",
      "not know it! You’ll come to a bad end, if you go \n",
      "with such friends, Thief Barrel-rider. I don’t mind \n",
      "if you go back and tell them so from me.” But he \n",
      "did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he \n",
      "could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was \n",
      "quite outside his experience and puzzled him \n",
      "mightily. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose you got a fair price for that cup \n",
      "last night?” he went on. “Come now, did you? \n",
      "Nothing at all! Well, that’s just like them. And I \n",
      "suppose they are skulking outside, and your job \n",
      "is to do all the dangerous work and get what \n",
      "you can when I’m not looking — for them? And \n",
      "you will get a fair share? Don’t you believe it! If \n",
      "you get off alive, you will be lucky.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo was now beginning to feel really \n",
      "uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug’s roving eye, \n",
      "seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire \n",
      "seized hold of him to rush out and reveal \n",
      "himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he \n",
      "was in grievous danger of coming under the \n",
      "dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke \n",
      "again. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know everything, O Smaug the \n",
      "Mighty,” said he. “Not gold alone brought us \n",
      "hither.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha! Ha! You admit the ‘us’” laughed \n",
      "Smaug. “Why not say ‘us fourteen’ and be done \n",
      "with it, Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear \n",
      "that you had other business in these parts \n",
      "besides my gold. In that case you may, \n",
      "perhaps, not altogether waste your time. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know if it has occurred to you that, \n",
      "even if you could steal the gold bit by bit — a \n",
      "matter of a hundred years or so — you could not \n",
      "get it very far? Not much use on the mountain- \n",
      "side? Not much use in the forest? Bless me! \n",
      "Had you never thought of the catch? A \n",
      "fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it, \n",
      "those were the terms, eh? But what about \n",
      "delivery? What about cartage? What about \n",
      "armed guards and tolls?” And Smaug laughed \n",
      "aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he \n",
      "knew his guesses were not far out, though he \n",
      "suspected that the Lake-men were at the back \n",
      "of the plans, and that most of the plunder was \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "meant to stop there in the town by the shore that \n",
      "in his young days had been called Esgaroth. \n",
      "\n",
      "You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was \n",
      "really very taken aback. So far all his thoughts \n",
      "and energies had been concentrated on getting \n",
      "to the Mountain and finding the entrance. He \n",
      "had never bothered to wonder how the treasure \n",

      "mind — had the dwarves forgotten this important \n",
      "point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves \n",
      "at him all the time? That is the effect that \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Revenge!” he snorted, and the light of his \n",
      "eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet \n",
      "lightning. ‘‘Revenge! The King under the \n",
      "Mountain is dead and where are his kin that \n",
      "dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is \n",
      "dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf \n",
      "among sheep, and where are his sons’ sons \n",
      "that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and \n",
      "none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old \n",
      "and their like is not in the world today. Then I \n",
      "was but young and tender. Now I am old and \n",
      "strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!” he \n",
      "gloated. “My armour is like tenfold shields, my \n",
      "teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock \n",

      "and my breath death!” \n",

      "“I have always understood,” said Bilbo in a \n",
      "frightened squeak, “that dragons were softer \n",

      "\n",
      "The dragon stopped short in his boasting. \n",

      "\n",
      "“I might have guessed it,” said Bilbo. “Truly \n",

      "peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, \n",
      "and was itching for a closer view for reasons of \n",
      "his own. The dragon rolled over. “Look!” he \n",
      "said. “What do you say to that?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! \n",
      "Staggering!” exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what \n",
      "he thought inside was: “Old fool! Why, there is a \n",
      "large patch in the hollow of his left breast as \n",
      "bare as a snail out of its shell!” \n",
      "\n",
      "After he had seen that Mr. Baggins’ one \n",

      "“or keep you from much needed rest. Ponies \n",
      "take some catching, I believe, after a long start. \n",
      "And so do burglars,” he added as a parting \n",
      "shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon \n",
      "spouted terrific flames after him, and fast \n",
      "though he sped up the slope, he had not gone \n",
      "nearly far enough to be comfortable before the \n",
      "ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the \n",
      "opening behind. Luckily the whole head and \n",
      "jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils sent \n",
      "forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was \n",
      "nearly overcome, and stumbled blindly on in \n",
      "great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "pleased with the cleverness of his conversation \n",
      "with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook \n",
      "him into better sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you \n",
      "fool!” he said to himself, and it became a \n",
      "favourite saying of his later, and passed into a \n",
      "proverb. ‘‘You aren’t nearly through this \n",
      "adventure yet,” he added, and that was pretty \n",
      "true as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon was turning into evening when he \n",
      "came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint \n",
      "on the ‘doorstep’. The dwarves revived him, \n",
      "and doctored his scorches as well as they \n",
      "could; but it was a long time before the hair on \n",
      "the back of his head and his heels grew \n",
      "properly again: it had all been singed and \n",
      "frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile \n",
      "his friends did their best to cheer him up; and \n",
      "they were eager for his story, especially wanting \n",
      "to know why the dragon had made such an \n",
      "awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the hobbit was worried and \n",
      "uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getting \n",
      "anything out of him. On thinking things over he \n",
      "was now regretting some of the things he had \n",
      "said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "them. The old thrush was sitting on a rock near \n",
      "by with his head cocked on one side, listening \n",
      "to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper \n",
      "Bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and threw it \n",
      "at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and \n",
      "came back. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Drat the bird!” said Bilbo crossly. “I believe \n",
      "he is listening, and I don’t like the look of him.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave him alone!” said Thorin. “The \n",
      "thrushes are good and friendly — this is a very \n",
      "old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the \n",
      "ancient breed that used to live about here, tame \n",
      "to the hands of my father and grandfather. They \n",
      "were a long-lived and magical race, and this \n",
      "might even be one of those that were alive then, \n",
      "a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The \n",
      "Men of Dale used to have the trick of \n",
      "understanding their language, and used them \n",
      "for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake \n",
      "and elsewhere.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he’ll have news to take to Lake-town \n",
      "all right, if that is what he is after,” said Bilbo; \n",
      "“though I don’t suppose there are any people \n",
      "left there that trouble with thrush-language.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why what has happened?” cried the \n",
      "dwarves. “Do get on with your tale!” \n",
      "\n",
      "So Bilbo told them all he could remember, \n",
      "and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling \n",
      "that the dragon guessed too much from his \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "riddles added to the camps and the ponies. “I \n",
      "am sure he knows we came from Lake-town \n",
      "and had help from there; and I have a horrible \n",
      "feeling that his next move may be in that \n",
      "direction. I wish to goodness I had never said \n",
      "that about Barrel-rider; it would make even a \n",
      "blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake- \n",
      "men.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is \n",
      "difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I \n",
      "have always heard,” said Balin anxious to \n",
      "comfort him. “I think you did very well, if you ask \n",
      "me — you found out one very useful thing at any \n",
      "rate, and got home alive, and that is more than \n",
      "most can say who have had words with the likes \n",
      "of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet \n",
      "to know of the bare patch in the old Worm’s \n",
      "diamond waistcoat.” \n",
      "\n",
      "That turned the conversation, and they all \n",
      "began discussing dragon-slayings historical, \n",
      "dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of \n",
      "stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different \n",
      "arts devices and stratagems by which they had \n",
      "been accomplished. The general opinion was \n",
      "that catching a dragon napping was not as easy \n",
      "as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or \n",
      "prod one asleep was more likely to end in \n",
      "disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while \n",
      "they talked the thrush listened, till at last when \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread \n",
      "its wings and flew away. And all the while they \n",
      "talked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo \n",
      "became more and more unhappy and his \n",
      "foreboding grew. \n",
      "\n",
      "At last he interrupted them. “I am sure we \n",
      "are very unsafe here,” he said, “and I don’t see \n",
      "the point of sitting here. The dragon has \n",
      "withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the \n",
      "night has come and it is cold. But I feel it in my \n",
      "bones that this place will be attacked again. \n",
      "Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, \n",
      "and you can trust him to guess where the other \n",
      "end of the tunnel is. He will break all this side of \n",
      "the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our \n",
      "entrance, and if we are smashed with it the \n",
      "better he will like it.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!” said \n",
      "Thorin. “Why has not Smaug blocked the lower \n",
      "end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He \n",
      "has not, or we should have heard him.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, I don’t know — because at first \n",
      "he wanted to try and lure me in again, I \n",
      "suppose, and now perhaps because he is \n",
      "waiting till after tonight’s hunt, or because he \n",
      "does not want to damage his bedroom if he can \n",
      "help it — but I wish you would not argue. Smaug \n",
      "will be coming out at any minute now, and our \n",
      "only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "door.” \n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed so much in earnest that the \n",
      "dwarves at last did as he said, though they \n",
      "delayed shutting the door — it seemed a \n",
      "desperate plan, for no one knew whether or \n",
      "how they could get it open again from the \n",
      "inside, and the thought of being shut in a place \n",
      "from which the only way out led through the \n",
      "dragon’s lair was not one they liked. Also \n",
      "everything seemed quite quiet, both outside \n",
      "and down the tunnel. So for a longish while they \n",
      "sat inside not far down from the half-open door \n",
      "and went on talking. \n",
      "\n",
      "The talk turned to the dragon’s wicked \n",
      "words about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had \n",
      "never heard them, or at least that he could feel \n",
      "quite certain that the dwarves now were \n",
      "absolutely honest when they declared that they \n",
      "had never thought at all about what would \n",
      "happen after the treasure had been won. “We \n",
      "knew it would be a desperate venture,” said \n",
      "Thorin, “and we know that still; and I still think \n",
      "that when we have won it will be time enough to \n",
      "think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. \n",
      "Baggins, I assure you we are more than grateful \n",
      "and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as \n",
      "soon as we have anything to divide. I am sorry if \n",
      "you are worried about transport, and I admit the \n",
      "difficulties are great — the lands have not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "become less wild with the passing of time, \n",
      "rather the reverse — but we will do whatever we \n",
      "can for you, and take our share of the cost when \n",
      "the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!” \n",
      "\n",
      "From that the talk turned to the great hoard \n",
      "itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin \n",
      "remembered. They wondered if they were still \n",
      "lying there unharmed in the hall below: the \n",
      "spears that were made for the armies of the \n",
      "great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each \n",
      "had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were \n",
      "inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never \n",
      "delivered or paid for; shields made for warriors \n",
      "long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two- \n",
      "handed, hammered and carven with birds and \n",
      "flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; \n",
      "coats of mail gilded and silvered and \n",
      "impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of \n",
      "Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as \n",
      "grass, which he gave for the arming of his \n",
      "eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the \n",
      "like of which had never been made before, for it \n",
      "was wrought of pure silver to the power and \n",
      "strength of triple steel. But fairest of all was the \n",
      "great white gem, which the dwarves had found \n",
      "beneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of \n",
      "the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!” \n",
      "murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "his chin upon his knees. “It was like a globe with \n",
      "a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the \n",
      "firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under \n",
      "the stars, like rain upon the Moon!” \n",
      "\n",
      "But the enchanted desire of the hoard had \n",
      "fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was \n",
      "only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the \n",
      "door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of \n",
      "a sound without, his other was alert for echoes \n",
      "beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any \n",
      "whisper of a movement from far below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness grew deeper and he grew ever \n",
      "more uneasy. “Shut the door!” he begged them, \n",
      "“I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this \n",
      "silence far less than the uproar of last night. \n",
      "Shut the door before it is too late!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Something in his voice gave the dwarves \n",
      "an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook \n",
      "off his dreams and getting up he kicked away \n",
      "the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust \n",
      "upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. \n",
      "No trace of a keyhole was there left on the \n",
      "inside. They were shut in the Mountain! \n",
      "\n",
      "And not a moment too soon. They had \n",
      "hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when \n",
      "a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the \n",
      "crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks \n",
      "and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the \n",
      "walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their heads. What would have happened if the \n",
      "door had still been open I don’t like to think. \n",
      "They fled further down the tunnel glad to be still \n",
      "alive, while behind them outside they heard the \n",
      "roar and rumble of Smaug’s fury. He was \n",
      "breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and \n",
      "cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their \n",
      "little lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, \n",
      "the thrush’s stone, the snail-covered walls, the \n",
      "narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble \n",
      "of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered \n",
      "stones fell over the cliff into the valley below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, \n",
      "quietly soared into the air, and then floated \n",
      "heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous \n",
      "crow, down the wind towards the west of the \n",
      "Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares \n",
      "something or somebody there, and of spying \n",
      "the outlet to the passage which the thief had \n",
      "used. This was the outburst of his wrath when \n",

      "where he guessed the outlet must actually be. \n",
      "\n",
      "After he had let off his rage in this way he \n",
      "felt better and he thought in his heart that he \n",
      "would not be troubled again from that direction. \n",
      "In the meanwhile he had further vengeance to \n",
      "take. “Barrel-rider!” he snorted. “Your feet came \n",
      "from the waterside and up the water you came \n",
      "without a doubt. I don’t know your smell, but if \n",

      "Third time pays for all.’ I am going down the \n",
      "tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, \n",
      "when I knew there was a dragon at the other \n",
      "end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no \n",
      "longer sure. Anyway the only way out is down. \n",
      "And I think this time you had better all come with \n",
      "me.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was \n",
      "the first to go forward by Bilbo’s side. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit, \n",
      "“and as quiet as you can be! There may be no \n",
      "Smaug at the bottom, but then again there may \n",
      "be. Don’t let us take any unnecessary risks!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down they went. The dwarves could \n",
      "not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and \n",
      "shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; \n",
      "but though every now and again Bilbo in fear \n",
      "stopped and listened, not a sound stirred \n",
      "below. Near the bottom, as well as he could \n",
      "judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went \n",
      "ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was \n",
      "complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no \n",
      "ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came \n",
      "to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on \n",
      "air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into \n",
      "the hall! \n",
      "\n",
      "There he lay face downwards on the floor \n",
      "and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to \n",
      "breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a \n",
      "gleam of light — unless, as it seemed to him, \n",
      "when at last he slowly raised his head, there \n",
      "was a pale white glint, above him and far off in \n",
      "the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of \n",
      "dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy \n",
      "in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his \n",
      "tongue. \n",
      "\n",
      "At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no \n",
      "longer. “Confound you, Smaug, you worm!” he \n",
      "squeaked aloud. “Stop playing hide-and-seek! \n",
      "Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can \n",
      "catch me!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but \n",
      "there was no answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know \n",
      "in what direction to turn. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is \n",
      "playing at,” he said. “He is not at home today \n",
      "(or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin \n",
      "and Gloin have not lost their tinder-boxes, \n",
      "perhaps we can make a little light, and have a \n",
      "look round before the luck turns.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Light!” he cried. “Can anybody make a \n",
      "light?” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed \n",
      "when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a \n",
      "bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just \n",
      "where he had left them at the end of the tunnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Sh! sh!” they hissed, when they heard his \n",
      "voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find \n",
      "out where they were, it was some time before \n",
      "he could get anything else out of them. But in \n",
      "the end, when Bilbo actually began to stamp on \n",
      "the floor, and screamed out “light!” at the top of \n",
      "his shrill voice, Thorin gave way, and Oin and \n",
      "Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top \n",
      "of the tunnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a while a twinkling gleam showed \n",
      "them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight \n",
      "in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door \n",
      "and took the torch; but he could not persuade \n",
      "the dwarves to light the others or to come and \n",
      "join him yet. As Thorin carefully explained, Mr. \n",
      "Baggins was still officially their expert burglar \n",
      "and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that \n",
      "was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for \n",
      "his report. So they sat near the door and \n",
      "watched. \n",
      "\n",
      "They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit \n",
      "start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft. \n",
      "Every now and again, while he was still near \n",
      "enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he \n",
      "stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew \n",
      "smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; \n",
      "then it began to rise dancing into the air. Bilbo \n",
      "was climbing the great mound of treasure. \n",
      "Soon he stood upon the top, and still went on. \n",
      "Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; \n",
      "but they did not know the reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the \n",
      "Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin’s \n",
      "description; but indeed there could not be two \n",
      "such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, \n",
      "even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the \n",
      "same white gleam had shone before him and \n",
      "drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew to a \n",
      "little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, \n",
      "it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "colours at the surface, reflected and splintered \n",
      "from the wavering light of his torch. At last he \n",
      "looked down upon it, and he caught his breath. \n",
      "The great jewel shone before his feet of its own \n",
      "inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the \n",
      "dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the \n",
      "mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon \n",
      "it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of \n",
      "white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Bilbo’s arm went towards it drawn \n",
      "by its enchantment. His small hand would not \n",
      "close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; \n",
      "but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his \n",
      "deepest pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I am a burglar indeed!” thought he. \n",
      "“But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it — \n",
      "some time. They did say I could pick and \n",
      "choose my own share; and I think I would \n",
      "choose this, if they took all the rest!” All the \n",
      "same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the \n",
      "picking and choosing had not really been meant \n",
      "to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble \n",
      "would yet come of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now he went on again. Down the other side \n",
      "of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of \n",
      "his torch vanished from the sight of the watching \n",
      "dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the \n",
      "distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of \n",
      "the hall. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on, until he came to the great \n",
      "doors at the further side, and there a draught of \n",
      "air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his \n",
      "light. He peeped timidly through, and caught a \n",
      "glimpse of great passages and of the dim \n",
      "beginnings of wide stairs going up into the \n",
      "gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound of \n",
      "Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, \n",
      "when a black shape swooped at him, and \n",
      "brushed his face. He squeaked and started, \n",
      "stumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped \n",
      "head downwards and went out! \n",
      "\n",
      "“Only a bat, I suppose and hope!” he said \n",
      "miserably. “But now what am I to do? Which is \n",
      "East, South, North, or West?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!” he cried \n",
      "as loud as he could — it seemed a thin little \n",
      "noise in the wide blackness. “The light’s gone \n",
      "out! Someone come and find me and help me!” \n",
      "For the moment his courage had failed \n",
      "altogether. \n",
      "\n",
      "Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, \n",
      "though the only word they could catch was \n",
      "“help!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Now what on earth or under it has \n",
      "happened?” said Thorin. “Certainly not the \n",
      "dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.” \n",
      "\n",
      "They waited a moment or two, and still there \n",
      "were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but Bilbo’s distant voice. “Come, one of you, \n",
      "get another light or two!” Thorin ordered. “It \n",
      "seems we have got to go and help our burglar.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“It is about our turn to help,” said Balin, “and \n",
      "I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it is \n",
      "safe for the moment.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Gloin lit several more torches, and then they \n",
      "all crept out, one by one, and went along the \n",
      "wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long \n",
      "before they met Bilbo himself coming back \n",
      "towards them. His wits had quickly returned as \n",
      "soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing \n",
      "worse!” he said in answer to their questions. \n",
      "Though they were much relieved, they were \n",
      "inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for \n",
      "nothing; but what they would have said, if he \n",
      "had told them at that moment about the \n",
      "Arkenstone, I don’t know. The mere fleeting \n",
      "glimpses of treasure which they had caught as \n",
      "they went along had rekindled all the fire of their \n",
      "dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, \n",
      "even the most respectable, is wakened by gold \n",
      "and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he \n",
      "may become fierce. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dwarves indeed no longer needed any \n",
      "urging. All were now eager to explore the hall \n",
      "while they had the chance, and willing to believe \n",
      "that, for the present, Smaug was away from \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and \n",
      "as they gazed, first on one side and then on \n",
      "another, they forgot fear and even caution. They \n",
      "spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as \n",
      "they lifted old treasures from the mound or from \n",
      "the wall and held them in the light, caressing \n",
      "and fingering them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, \n",
      "and finding still hanging there many golden \n",
      "harps strung with silver they took them and \n",
      "struck them; and being magical (and also \n",
      "untouched by the dragon, who had small \n",
      "interest in music) they were still in tune. The \n",
      "dark hall was filled with a melody that had long \n",
      "been silent. But most of the dwarves were more \n",
      "practical: they gathered gems and stuffed their \n",
      "pockets, and let what they could not carry fall \n",
      "back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin \n",
      "was not least among these; but always he \n",
      "searched from side to side for something which \n",
      "he could not find. It was the Arkenstone; but he \n",
      "spoke of it yet to no one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the dwarves took down mail and \n",
      "weapons from the walls, and armed \n",
      "themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad \n",
      "in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver- \n",
      "hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Baggins!” he cried. “Here is the first \n",
      "payment of your reward! Cast off your old coat \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and put on this!” \n",
      "\n",
      "With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of \n",
      "mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long \n",
      "ago. It was of silver-steel, which the elves call \n",
      "mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and \n",
      "crystals. A light helm of figured leather, \n",
      "strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and \n",
      "studded about the brim with white gems, was \n",
      "set upon the hobbit’s head. \n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel magnificent,” he thought; “but I expect \n",
      "I look rather absurd. How they would laugh on \n",
      "the Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking- \n",
      "glass handy!” \n",
      "\n",
      "All the same Mr. Baggins kept his head \n",
      "more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than \n",
      "the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were \n",
      "tired of examining the treasures, he became \n",
      "weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he \n",
      "began to wonder nervously what the end of it all \n",
      "would be. “I would give a good many of these \n",
      "precious goblets,” he thought, “for a drink of \n",
      "something cheering out of one of Beorn’s \n",
      "wooden bowls!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Thorin!” he cried aloud. “What next? We \n",
      "are armed, but what good has any armour ever \n",
      "been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This \n",
      "treasure is not yet won back. We are not \n",
      "looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; \n",
      "and we have tempted luck too long!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak the truth!” answered Thorin, \n",
      "recovering his wits. “Let us go! I will guide you. \n",
      "Not in a thousand years should I forget the ways \n",
      "of this palace.” Then he hailed the others, and \n",
      "they gathered together, and holding their \n",
      "torches above their heads they passed through \n",
      "the gaping doors, not without many a backward \n",
      "glance of longing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their glittering mail they had covered again \n",
      "with their old cloaks and their bright helms with \n",
      "their tattered hoods, and one by one they \n",
      "walked behind Thorin, a line of little lights in the \n",
      "darkness that halted often, listening in fear once \n",
      "more for any rumour of the dragon’s coming. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though all the old adornments were long \n",
      "mouldered or destroyed, and though all was \n",
      "befouled and blasted with the comings and \n",
      "goings of the monster, Thorin knew every \n",
      "passage and every turn. They climbed long \n",
      "stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing \n",
      "ways, and turned again and climbed yet more \n",
      "stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were \n",
      "smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair; \n",
      "and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no \n",
      "sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that \n",
      "fled from the approach of their torches fluttering \n",
      "in the draughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The steps were not made, all the same, for \n",
      "hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof \n",
      "sprang high and far beyond the reach of their \n",
      "torch-light. A white glimmer could be seen \n",
      "coming through some opening far above, and \n",
      "the air smelt sweeter. Before them light came \n",
      "dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on \n",
      "their hinges and half burnt. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the great chamber of Thror,” said \n",
      "Thorin; “the hall of feasting and of council. Not \n",
      "far off now is the Front Gate.” \n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through the ruined chamber. \n",
      "Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches \n",
      "were lying there overturned, charred and \n",
      "decaying. Skulls and bones were upon the floor \n",
      "among flagons and bowls and broken drinking- \n",
      "horns and dust. As they came through yet more \n",
      "doors at the further end, a sound of water fell \n",
      "upon their ears, and the grey light grew \n",
      "suddenly more full. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There is the birth of the Running River,” \n",
      "said Thorin. “From here it hastens to the Gate. \n",
      "Let us follow it!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there \n",
      "issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in \n",
      "a narrow channel, carved and made straight \n",
      "and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. \n",
      "Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough \n",
      "for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they \n",
      "ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn — and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "behold! before them stood the broad light of \n",
      "day. In front there rose a tall arch, still showing \n",
      "the fragments of old carven work within, worn \n",
      "and splintered and blackened though it was. A \n",
      "misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of \n",
      "the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the \n",
      "pavement at the threshold. \n",
      "\n",
      "A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by \n",
      "their smoking torches flurried over them; as they \n",
      "sprang forward their feet slithered on stones \n",
      "rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of \n",
      "the dragon. Now before them the water fell \n",
      "noisily outward and foamed down towards the \n",
      "valley. They flung their pale torches to the \n",
      "ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled \n",
      "eyes. They were come to the Front Gate, and \n",
      "were looking out upon Dale. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Bilbo, “I never expected to be \n",
      "looking out of this door. And I never expected to \n",
      "be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel \n",
      "the wind on my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!” \n",
      "\n",
      "It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a \n",
      "threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and \n",
      "round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, \n",
      "and sighed among the rocks. After their long \n",
      "time in the stewing depths of the dragon- \n",
      "haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only \n",
      "tired but also very hungry indeed. “It seems to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "be late morning,” he said, ‘‘and so I suppose it \n",
      "is more or less breakfast-time — if there is any \n",
      "breakfast to have. But I don’t feel that Smaug’s \n",
      "front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do \n",
      "let’s go somewhere where we can sit quiet for a \n",
      "bit!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite right!” said Balin. “And I think I know \n",
      "which way we should go: we ought to make for \n",
      "the old look-out post at the South-West corner \n",
      "of the Mountain.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“How far is that?” asked the hobbit. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Five hours march, I should think. It will be \n",
      "rough going. The road from the Gate along the \n",
      "left edge of the stream seems all broken up. But \n",

      "across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that \n",
      "point there was once a bridge, leading to steep \n",

      "a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or \n",

      "path, so on they trudged among the stones on \n",
      "the left side of the river, and the emptiness and \n",
      "desolation soon sobered even Thorin again. \n",
      "The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found \n",
      "long fallen, and most of its stones were now \n",
      "only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but \n",
      "they forded the water without much difficulty, \n",
      "and found the ancient steps, and climbed the \n",
      "high bank. After going a short way they struck \n",
      "the old road, and before long came to a deep \n",
      "dell sheltered among the rocks; there they \n",
      "rested for a while and had such a breakfast as \n",
      "they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want \n",
      "to know what cram is, I can only say that I don’t \n",
      "know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good \n",
      "indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and \n",
      "is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very \n",
      "uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It \n",

      "\n",
      "After that they went on again; and now the \n",
      "road struck westwards and left the river, and the \n",
      "great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain- \n",
      "spur drew ever nearer. At length they reached \n",
      "the hill path. It scrambled steeply up, and they \n",
      "plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last \n",
      "in the late afternoon they came to the top of the \n",
      "ridqe and saw the wintry sun qoinq downwards \n",
      "to the West. \n",

      "Here they found a flat place without a wall \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "on three sides, but backed to the North by a \n",
      "rocky face in which there was an opening like a \n",

      "East and South and West. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Here,” said Balin, “in the old days we used \n",
      "always to keep watchmen, and that door behind \n",
      "leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made \n",
      "here as a guardroom. There were several \n",
      "places like it round the Mountain. But there \n",
      "seemed small need for watching in the days of \n",
      "our prosperity, and the guards were made over \n",
      "comfortable, perhaps — otherwise we might \n",
      "have had longer warning of the coming of the \n",
      "dragon, and things might have been different. \n",
      "Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not much use, if we have been seen \n",

      "room for a hundred, and there was a small \n",

      "once and slept, but the others sat near the outer \n",
      "door and discussed their plans. In all their talk \n",
      "they came perpetually back to one thing: where \n",
      "was Smaug? They looked West and there was \n",
      "nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the \n",
      "South there was no sign of the dragon, but there \n",
      "was a gathering of very many birds. At that they \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "glow touched it and faded. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” said one. “The lights again! Last \n",

      "Then suddenly a great light appeared in the \n",

      "\n",
      "There was once more a tremendous \n",

      "more bright, and not the most foolish doubted \n",
      "that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. Still \n",

      "before the roar of Smaug’s terrible approach \n",

      "and his enemies were on an island in deep \n",
      "water — too deep and dark and cool for his \n",
      "liking. If he plunged into it, a vapour and a \n",
      "steam would arise enough to cover all the land \n",
      "with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier \n",
      "than he, it would quench him before he could \n",
      "pass through. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail \n",
      "of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts \n",

      "twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the \n",

      "\n",
      "Fire leaped from the dragon’s jaws. He \n",

      "lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores \n",
      "shone like copper and like blood with leaping \n",

      "only to set their town ablaze. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fire leaped from thatched roofs and \n",
      "wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and \n",
      "past and round again, though all had been \n",
      "drenched with water before he came. Once \n",
      "more water was flung by a hundred hands \n",
      "wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the \n",
      "dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great House crumbled and smashed down. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "mourning and weeping, where but a little time \n",
      "ago the old songs of mirth to come had been \n",
      "sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their \n",
      "names. The Master himself was turning to his \n",
      "great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the \n",
      "confusion and save himself. Soon all the town \n",
      "would be deserted and burned down to the \n",
      "surface of the lake. \n",
      "\n",
      "That was the dragon’s hope. They could all \n",
      "get into boats for all he cared. There he could \n",
      "have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop \n",
      "till they starved. Let them try to get to land and \n",
      "he would be ready. Soon he would set all the \n",

      "and grim-faced, whose friends had accused \n",
      "him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, \n",
      "though they knew his worth and courage. He \n",
      "was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of \n",
      "Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down \n",
      "the Running River from the ruin long ago. Now \n",
      "he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows \n",
      "but one were spent. The flames were near him. \n",
      "His companions were leaving him. He bent his \n",
      "bow for the last time. \n",
      "\n",
      "S ud d e nly o ut of the d a rk so methi ng fl utte red \n",
      "to his shoulder. He started — but it was only an \n",
      "old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it \n",

      "understand its tongue, for he was of the race of \n",
      "Dale. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait! Wait!” it said to him. “The moon is \n",

      "\n",
      "Then Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. \n",
      "The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as \n",

      "breast where the foreleg was flung wide. In it \n",
      "smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so \n",
      "fierce was its flight. With a shriek that deafened \n",
      "men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot \n",

      "sudden dark under the moon. There was a hiss, \n",
      "a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was \n",

      "“We will have King Bard!” the people near \n",

      "“I am the last man to undervalue Bard the \n",
      "Bowman,” said the Master warily (for Bard now \n",
      "stood close beside him). “He has tonight \n",
      "earned an eminent place in the roll of the \n",
      "benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of \n",
      "many imperishable songs. But, why O \n",
      "People?” — and here the Master rose to his feet \n",
      "and spoke very loud and clear — “Why do I get \n",
      "all your blame? For what fault am I to be \n",
      "deposed? Who aroused the dragon from his \n",
      "slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich \n",
      "gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that \n",
      "old songs could come true? Who played on our \n",
      "soft hearts and our pleasant fancies? What sort \n",
      "of gold have they sent down the river to reward \n",
      "us? Dragon-fire and ruin! From whom should \n",

      "aid for our widows and orphans?” \n",
      "\n",
      "As you see, the Master had not got his \n",
      "position for nothing. The result of his words was \n",
      "that for the moment the people quite forgot their \n",
      "idea of a new king, and turned their angry \n",
      "thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild \n",
      "and bitter words were shouted from many \n",

      "the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless \n",
      "they perished first in fire, before Smaug came \n",
      "to us.” Then even as he was speaking, the \n",
      "thought came into his heart of the fabled \n",
      "treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or \n",
      "owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of \n",
      "the Master’s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and \n",
      "filled with golden bells, if he could but find the \n",
      "men. \n",
      "\n",
      "At length he spoke again: “This is no time \n",
      "for angry words, Master, or for considering \n",
      "weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I \n",
      "serve you still — though after a while I may think \n",
      "again of your words and go North with any that \n",
      "will follow me.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he strode off to help in the ordering of \n",
      "the camps and in the care of the sick and the \n",
      "wounded. But the Master scowled at his back \n",
      "as he went, and remained sitting on the ground. \n",
      "He thought much but said little, unless it was to \n",
      "call loudly for men to bring him fire and food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now everywhere Bard went he found talk \n",
      "running like fire among the people concerning \n",
      "the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men \n",
      "spoke of the recompense for all their harm that \n",
      "they would soon get from it, and wealth over \n",
      "and to spare with which to buy rich things from \n",
      "the South; and it cheered them greatly in their \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter \n",
      "and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for \n",
      "few (the Master had one) and there was little \n",
      "food (even the Master went short). Many took ill \n",
      "of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and \n",
      "afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured \n",
      "from the ruin of the town; and in the days that \n",
      "followed there was much sickness and great \n",
      "hunger. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered \n",
      "things as he wished, though always in the \n",
      "Master’s name, and he had a hard task to \n",
      "govern the people and direct the preparations \n",
      "for their protection and housing. Probably most \n",
      "of them would have perished in the winter that \n",
      "now hurried after autumn, if help had not been \n",
      "to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once \n",
      "had speedy messengers sent up the river to the \n",
      "Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of \n",
      "the Wood, and these messengers had found a \n",
      "host already on the move, although it was then \n",
      "only the third day after the fall of Smaug. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Elvenking had received news from his \n",
      "own messengers and from the birds that loved \n",
      "his folk, and already knew much of what had \n",
      "happened. Very great indeed was the \n",
      "commotion among all things with wings that \n",
      "dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the \n",
      "Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and their swift-flying messengers flew here and \n",
      "there across the sky. Above the borders of the \n",
      "Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. \n",
      "Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: “Smaug is \n",
      "dead!” Leaves rustled and startled ears were \n",
      "lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the \n",
      "news had passed west right to the pinewoods \n",
      "of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in \n",
      "his wooden house, and the goblins were at \n",
      "council in their caves. \n",
      "\n",
      "“That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin \n",
      "Oakenshield, I fear,” said the king. “He would \n",
      "have done better to have remained my guest. It \n",
      "is an ill wind, all the same,” he added, “that \n",
      "blows no one any good.” For he too had not \n",
      "forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it \n",
      "was that Bard’s messengers found him now \n",
      "marching with many spearmen and bowmen; \n",
      "and crows were gathered thick above him, for \n",
      "they thought that war was awakening again, \n",

      "age. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the king, when he received the prayers \n",
      "of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good \n",
      "and kindly people; so turning his march, which \n",
      "had at first been direct towards the Mountain, \n",
      "he hastened now down the river to the Long \n",
      "Lake. He had not boats or rafts enough for his \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "they were not in these days much used to the \n",
      "marches and the treacherous lands between \n",
      "the Forest and the Lake, their going was swift. \n",
      "Only five days after the death of the dragon they \n",
      "came upon the shores and looked on the ruins \n",
      "of the town. Their welcome was good, as may \n",
      "be expected, and the men and their Master \n",
      "were ready to make any bargain for the future in \n",
      "return for the Elvenking’s aid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their plans were soon made. With the \n",
      "women and the children, the old and the unfit, \n",
      "the Master remained behind; and with him were \n",
      "some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and \n",
      "they busied themselves felling trees, and \n",
      "collecting the timber sent down from the Forest. \n",
      "Then they set about raising many huts by the \n",
      "shore against the oncoming winter; and also \n",
      "under the Master’s direction they began the \n",
      "planning of a new town, designed more fair and \n",
      "large even than before, but not in the same \n",
      "place. They removed northward higher up the \n",
      "shore; for ever after they had a dread of the \n",
      "water where the dragon lay. He would never \n",
      "again return to his golden bed, but was \n",
      "stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor \n",
      "of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones \n",
      "could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the \n",
      "cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the \n",
      "shivering water or recover the precious stones \n",
      "that fell from his rotting carcase. \n",
      "\n",
      "But all the men of arms who were still able, \n",
      "and the most of the Elvenking’s array, got ready \n",
      "to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that \n",
      "in eleven days from the ruin of the town the \n",

      "Sure enough the old thrush was there, and \n",

      "\n",

      "bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He \n",

      "fifty since I came out of the egg, but I do not \n",

      "counsel, you will not trust the Master of the \n",

      "\n",

      "the death of the dragon — in which he was much \n",

      "\n",
      "As you have heard some of the events already, \n",

      "days before them. They explored the caverns \n",
      "once more, and found, as they expected, that \n",
      "only the Front Gate remained open; all the other \n",

      "they began to labour hard in fortifying the main \n",
      "entrance, and in making a new path that led \n",
      "from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the \n",
      "miners and quarriers and builders of old had \n",
      "used; and at such work the dwarves were still \n",
      "very skilled. \n",
      "\n",
      "As they worked the ravens brought them \n",
      "constant tidings. In this way they learned that the \n",
      "Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and \n",
      "they still had a breathing space. Better still, they \n",
      "heard that three of their ponies had escaped \n",
      "and were wandering wild far down the banks of \n",
      "the Running River, not far from where the rest of \n",
      "their stores had been left. So while the others \n",
      "went on with their work, Fili and Kili were sent, \n",
      "guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring \n",
      "back all they could. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were four days gone, and by that time \n",
      "they knew that the joined armies of the Lake- \n",
      "men and the Elves were hurrying toward the \n",
      "Mountain. But now their hopes were higher; for \n",
      "they had food for some weeks with care — \n",

      "already the gate was blocked with a wall of \n",
      "squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high, \n",
      "across the opening. There were holes in the \n",
      "wall through which they could see (or shoot), but \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "no entrance. They climbed in or out with \n",
      "ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the \n",
      "issuing of the stream they had contrived a small \n",
      "low arch under the new wall; but near the \n",
      "entrance they had so altered the narrow bed \n",
      "that a wide pool stretched from the mountain- \n",
      "wall to the head of the fall over which the stream \n",
      "went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was \n",
      "now only possible, without swimming, along a \n",
      "narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one \n",
      "looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they \n",
      "had brought only to the head of the steps above \n",
      "the old bridge, and unloading them there had \n",

      "\n",
      "There came a night when suddenly there were \n",
      "many lights as of fires and torches away south \n",
      "in Dale before them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“They have come!” called Balin. “And their \n",
      "camp is very great. They must have come into \n",
      "the valley under the cover of dusk along both \n",
      "banks of the river.” \n",
      "\n",
      "That night the dwarves slept little. The \n",
      "morning was still pale when they saw a \n",
      "company approaching. From behind their wall \n",
      "they watched them come up to the valley’s head \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and climb slowly up. Before long they could see \n",
      "that both men of the lake armed as if for war \n",
      "and elvish bowmen were among them. At length \n",
      "the foremost of these climbed the tumbled \n",
      "rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and \n",
      "very great was their surprise to see the pool \n",
      "before them and the Gate blocked with a wall of \n",
      "new-hewn stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "As they stood pointing and speaking to one \n",
      "another Thorin hailed them: “Who are you,” he \n",
      "called in a very loud voice, “that come as if in \n",
      "war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King \n",
      "under the Mountain, and what do you desire?” \n",
      "\n",
      "But they answered nothing. Some turned \n",
      "swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a \n",
      "while at the Gate and its defences soon \n",
      "followed them. That day the camp was moved \n",
      "to the east of the river, right between the arms \n",
      "of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with \n",
      "voices and with song, as they had not done for \n",
      "many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven- \n",
      "harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up \n",
      "towards them it seemed that the chill of the air \n",
      "was warmed, and they caught faintly the \n",
      "fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in \n",
      "spring. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and \n",

      "\n",
      "Then the dwarves themselves brought forth \n",
      "harps and instruments regained from the hoard, \n",
      "and made music to soften his mood; but their \n",

      "Lonely Mountain, if he had set out as soon as \n",

      "\n",
      "The next morning early a company of \n",

      "\n",
      "A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and \n",
      "grim of face, and he cried: “Hail Thorin! Why do \n",
      "you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We \n",
      "are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are \n",
      "alive beyond our hope. We came expecting to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "find none living here; yet now that we are met \n",
      "there is matter for a parley and a council.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you, and of what would you \n",
      "parley?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon \n",
      "slain and your treasure delivered. Is that not a \n",
      "matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by \n",
      "right descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in \n",
      "your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his \n",
      "halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is \n",
      "not that a matter of which we may speak? \n",
      "Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the \n",
      "dwellings of the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet \n",
      "the servant of their Master. I would speak for \n",
      "him and ask whether you have no thought for \n",
      "the sorrow and misery of his people. They \n",
      "aided you in your distress, and in recompense \n",
      "you have thus far brought ruin only, though \n",
      "doubtless undesigned.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Now these were fair words and true, if \n",
      "proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought \n",
      "that Thorin would at once admit what justice \n",
      "was in them. He did not, of course, expect that \n",
      "any one would remember that it was he who \n",
      "discovered all by himself the dragon’s weak \n",
      "spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever \n",
      "did. But also he did not reckon with the power \n",
      "that gold has upon which a dragon has long \n",
      "brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in the past days Thorin had spent in the \n",
      "treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. \n",
      "Though he had hunted chiefly for the \n",
      "Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another \n",
      "wonderful thing that was lying there, about which \n",
      "were wound old memories of the labours and \n",
      "the sorrows of his race. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You put your worst cause last and in the \n",
      "chief place,” Thorin answered. “To the treasure \n",
      "of my people no man has a claim, because \n",
      "Smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of \n",
      "life or home. The treasure was not his that his \n",
      "evil deeds should be amended with a share of \n",
      "it. The price of the goods and the assistance \n",
      "that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly \n",
      "pay — in due time. But nothing will we give, not \n",
      "even a loafs worth, under threat offeree. While \n",
      "an armed host lies before our doors, we look on \n",
      "you as foes and thieves. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It is in my mind to ask what share of their \n",
      "inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, \n",
      "had you found the hoard unguarded and us \n",
      "slain.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“A just question,” replied Bard. “But you are \n",
      "not dead, and we are not robbers. Moreover the \n",
      "wealthy may have pity beyond right on the \n",
      "needy that befriended them when they were in \n",

      "Elvenking, whom I remember with small \n",
      "kindness. In this debate they have no place. \n",
      "Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you \n",
      "would speak with me again, first dismiss the \n",
      "elvish host to the woods where it belongs, and \n",
      "then return, laying down your arms before you \n",
      "approach the threshold.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“The Elvenking is my friend, and he has \n",
      "succoured the people of the Lake in their need, \n",
      "though they had no claim but friendship on him,” \n",
      "answered Bard. “We will give you time to repent \n",
      "your words. Gather your wisdom ere we return!” \n",
      "Then he departed and went back to the camp. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ere many hours were past, the banner- \n",
      "bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth \n",

      "“In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,” \n",
      "one cried, “we speak unto Thorin Thrain’s son \n",
      "Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the \n",
      "Mountain, and we bid him consider well the \n",
      "claims that have been urged, or be declared \n",
      "our foe. At the least he shall deliver one twelfth \n",
      "portion of the treasure unto Bard, as the \n",
      "dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From \n",
      "that portion Bard will himself contribute to the \n",
      "aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "friendship and honour of the lands about, as his \n",
      "sires had of old, then he will give also \n",
      "somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men \n",
      "of the Lake.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot \n",
      "an arrow at the speaker. It smote into his shield \n",
      "and stuck there quivering. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Since such is your answer,” he called in \n",
      "return, “I declare the Mountain besieged. You \n",
      "shall not depart from it, until you call on your \n",
      "side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no \n",
      "weapons against you, but we leave you to your \n",
      "gold. You may eat that, if you will!” \n",
      "\n",
      "With that the messengers departed swiftly, \n",
      "and the dwarves were left to consider their \n",
      "case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if \n",
      "they had wished, the others would not have \n",
      "dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of \n",
      "them seemed to share his mind — except \n",
      "perhaps old fat Bomburand Fili and Kili. Bilbo, \n",
      "of course, disapproved of the whole turn of \n",
      "affairs. He had by now had more than enough of \n",
      "the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was \n",
      "not at all to his taste. \n",
      "\n",

      "the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them \n",

      "“For the Arkenstone of my father,” he said, \n",

      "just within the gate and drew from his bundle a \n",

      "when he left the newly made path and climbed \n",
      "down towards the lower course of the stream, \n",

      "the stream was there shallow but already broad, \n",
      "and fording it in the dark was not easy for the \n",
      "little hobbit. He was nearly across when he \n",

      "deduct what is right from the total before putting \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it \n",

      "gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your \n",
      "bargaining.” Then Bilbo, not without a shudder, \n",
      "not without a glance of longing, handed the \n",

      "hand, as though dazed. \n",

      "But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so. \n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing they could say would stop him; so \n",
      "an escort was provided for him, and as he went \n",
      "both the king and Bard saluted him with honour. \n",
      "As they passed through the camp an old man, \n",

      "where he was sitting and came towards them. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well done! Mr. Baggins!” he said, clapping \n",

      "you than anyone expects!” It was Gandalf. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time for many a day Bilbo was \n",

      "\n",
      "“All in good time!” said Gandalf. “Things are \n",

      "mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in \n",
      "front of you; but keep your heart up! You may \n",

      "\n",

      "well before midnight when he clambered up the \n",
      "rope again — it was still where he had left it. He \n",

      "happen next. \n",
      "\n",
      "At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then \n",
      "in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without \n",

      "before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Dear me! Dear me!” said Bilbo. “I am sure \n",
      "this is all very uncomfortable. You may \n",

      "fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally \n",

      "been of some service. Descendant of rats, \n",
      "indeed! Is this all the service of you and your \n",

      "betrayed,” he said. “It was rightly guessed that I \n",
      "could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the \n",
      "treasure of my house. For it I will give one \n",
      "fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, \n",

      "you, which was made by my folk, and is too \n",
      "good for you. It cannot be pierced by arrows; \n",

      "miserable feet. So be swift!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so hasty!” said Bard. “We will give you \n",
      "until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if \n",
      "you have brought from the hoard the portion that \n",
      "is to be set against the stone. If that is done \n",
      "without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf- \n",
      "host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile \n",
      "farewell!” \n",

      "\n",
      "That day passed and the night. The next day the \n",

      "report that a host of dwarves had appeared \n",
      "round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was \n",
      "now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He had \n",
      "hurried on through the night, and so had come \n",
      "upon them sooner than they had expected. \n",
      "Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of \n",
      "steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs \n",
      "were covered with hose of a fine and flexible \n",
      "metal mesh, the secret of whose making was \n",
      "possessed by Dain’s people. The dwarves are \n",
      "exceedingly strong for their height, but most of \n",
      "these were strong even for dwarves. In battle \n",
      "they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but \n",
      "each of them had also a short broad sword at \n",
      "his side and a roundshield slung at his back. \n",
      "Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust \n",
      "into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they \n",

      "few held on their way, and crossing the river \n",
      "drew near the camp; and there they laid down \n",
      "their weapons and held up their hands in sign of \n",

      "\n",
      "Bard, of course, refused to allow the \n",
      "dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. He \n",

      "had been brought out in exchange for the \n",
      "Arkenstone; for he did not believe that this \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, and \n",
      "nearly all of Dain’s folk, in spite of their rapid \n",

      "siege for weeks, and by that time yet more \n",
      "dwarves might come, and yet more, for Thorin \n",
      "had many relatives. Also they would be able to \n",
      "reopen and guard some other gate, so that the \n",
      "besiegers would have to encircle the whole \n",
      "mountain; and for that they had not sufficient \n",
      "numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "These were, in fact, precisely their plans \n",
      "(for the raven-messengers had been busy \n",
      "between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment \n",
      "the way was barred, so after angry words the \n",
      "dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their \n",
      "beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to \n",
      "the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. \n",
      "Arrows came forth as soon as they were within \n",
      "shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In the \n",
      "camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the \n",
      "dwarves of Dain were advancing along the \n",
      "eastern bank. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Fools!” laughed Bard, “to come thus \n",
      "beneath the Mountain’s arm! They do not \n",
      "understand war above ground, whatever they \n",
      "may know of battle in the mines. There are \n",
      "many of our archers and spearmen now hidden \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "may be good, but they will soon be hard put to \n",

      "before they are fully rested!” \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Elvenking said: “Long will I tarry, ere \n",
      "I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot \n",
      "pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we \n",
      "cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that \n",
      "will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in \n",
      "numbers will be enough, if in the end it must \n",
      "come to unhappy blows.” \n",
      "\n",
      "But he reckoned without the dwarves. The \n",
      "knowledge that the Arkenstone was in the \n",
      "hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; \n",
      "also they guessed the hesitation of Bard and \n",
      "his friends, and resolved to strike while they \n",
      "debated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly without a signal they sprang \n",
      "silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and \n",
      "arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still more suddenly a darkness came on \n",
      "with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried \n",
      "over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind \n",
      "rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, \n",
      "and lightning lit its peak. And beneath the \n",
      "thunder another blackness could be seen \n",
      "whirling forward; but it did not come with the \n",
      "wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of \n",
      "birds, so dense that no light could be seen \n",
      "between their wings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halt!” cried Gandalf, who appeared \n",
      "suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, \n",
      "between the advancing dwarves and the ranks \n",
      "awaiting them. “Halt!” he called in a voice like \n",
      "thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash \n",
      "like the lightning. “Dread has come upon you \n",
      "all! Alas! it has come more swiftly than I \n",
      "guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg- of \n",
      "the North is coming, O Dain! whose father you \n",
      "slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his \n",
      "army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon \n",
      "wolves and Wargs are in their train!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Amazement and confusion fell upon them \n",
      "all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the \n",
      "darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed \n",
      "at the sky. The elves cried out with many voices. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” called Gandalf. “There is yet time \n",
      "for council. Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to \n",
      "us!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So began a battle that none had expected; and \n",
      "it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it \n",
      "was very terrible. Upon one side were the \n",
      "Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the \n",
      "other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is \n",
      "how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great \n",
      "Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. \n",
      "Messengers had passed to and fro between all \n",
      "their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they \n",
      "resolved now to win the dominion of the North. \n",
      "Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and \n",
      "in all the mountains there was a forging and an \n",
      "arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill \n",
      "and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, \n",
      "until around and beneath the great mountain \n",
      "Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, \n",
      "a vast host was assembled ready to sweep \n",
      "down in time of storm unawares upon the \n",
      "South. Then they learned of the death of \n",
      "Smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they \n",
      "hastened night after night through the \n",
      "mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden \n",
      "from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not \n",
      "even the ravens knew of their coming until they \n",
      "came out in the broken lands which divided the \n",
      "Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How \n",
      "much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is \n",
      "plain that he had not expected this sudden \n",
      "assault. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the plan that he made in council with \n",
      "the Elven-king and with Bard; and with Dain, for \n",
      "the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins \n",
      "were the foes of all, and at their coming all other \n",
      "quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was to \n",
      "lure the goblins into the valley between the arms \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of the Mountain; and themselves to man the \n",
      "great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this \n",
      "would be perilous, if the goblins were in \n",
      "sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain \n",
      "itself, and so attack them also from behind and \n",
      "above; but there was no time to make any other \n",
      "plan, or to summon any help. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the thunder passed, rolling away to \n",
      "the South-East; but the bat-cloud came, flying \n",
      "lower, over the shoulder of the Mountain, and \n",
      "whirled above them shutting out the light and \n",
      "filling them with dread. \n",
      "\n",
      "“To the Mountain!” called Bard. “To the \n",
      "Mountain! Let us take our places while there is \n",
      "yet time!” \n",
      "\n",
      "On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes \n",
      "and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; \n",
      "on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves. \n",
      "But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and \n",
      "elves climbed to the height of the Eastern \n",
      "shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon they \n",
      "could see the lands before the Mountain’s feet \n",
      "black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the \n",
      "vanguard swirled round the spur’s end and \n",
      "came rushing into Dale. These were the \n",
      "swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and \n",
      "howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were \n",
      "strung before them to make a feint of \n",
      "resistance, and many there fell before the rest \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf \n",
      "had hoped, the goblin army had gathered \n",
      "behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now \n",
      "in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between \n",
      "the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. \n",
      "Their banners were countless, black and red, \n",
      "and they came on like a tide in fury and \n",
      "disorder. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of \n",
      "all Bilbo’s experiences, and the one which at \n",
      "the time he hated most — which is to say it was \n",
      "the one he was most proud of, and most fond of \n",
      "recalling long afterwards, although he was quite \n",
      "unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on \n",
      "his ring early in the business, and vanished \n",
      "from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring \n",
      "of that sort is not a complete protection in a \n",
      "goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows \n",
      "and wild spears; but it does help in getting out \n",
      "of the way, and it prevents your head from being \n",
      "specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a \n",
      "goblin swordsman. \n",
      "\n",
      "The elves were the first to charge. Their \n",
      "hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their \n",
      "spears and swords shone in the gloom with a \n",
      "gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of \n",
      "the hands that held them. As soon as the host of \n",
      "their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent \n",
      "against it a shower of arrows, and each \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind \n",
      "the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt \n",
      "down and charged. The yells were deafening. \n",
      "The rocks were stained black with goblin blood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the goblins were recovering from \n",
      "the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, \n",
      "there rose from across the valley a deep- \n",
      "throated roar. With cries of “Moria!” and “Dain, \n",
      "Dain!” the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in, \n",
      "wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; \n",
      "and beside them came the men of the Lake \n",
      "with long swords. \n",
      "\n",
      "Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as \n",
      "they turned to meet this new attack, the elves \n",
      "charged again with renewed numbers. Already \n",
      "many of the goblins were flying back down the \n",
      "river to escape from the trap; and many of their \n",
      "own wolves were turning upon them and \n",
      "rending the dead and the wounded. Victory \n",
      "seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the \n",
      "heights above. \n",
      "\n",
      "Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the \n",
      "other side and already many were on the \n",
      "slopes above the Gate, and others were \n",
      "streaming down recklessly, heedless of those \n",
      "that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to \n",
      "attack the spurs from above. Each of these \n",
      "could be reached by paths that ran down from \n",
      "the main mass of the Mountain in the centre; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and the defenders had too few to bar the way \n",
      "for long. Victory now vanished from hope. They \n",
      "had only stemmed the first onslaught of the \n",
      "black tide. \n",
      "\n",
      "Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in \n",
      "the valley. There a host of Wargs came \n",
      "ravening and with them came the bodyguard of \n",
      "Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of \n",
      "steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a \n",
      "stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled \n",
      "about the heads and ears of elves and men, or \n",
      "fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now \n",
      "Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern spur, \n",
      "and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords \n",
      "were at bay about their king upon the southern \n",
      "arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly there was a great shout, and from \n",
      "the Gate came a trumpet call. They had \n",
      "forgotten Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by \n",
      "levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. \n",
      "Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his \n",
      "companions followed him. Hood and cloak \n",
      "were gone; they were in shining armour, and \n",
      "red light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the \n",
      "great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rocks were hurled down from on high by \n",
      "the goblins above; but they held on, leapt down \n",
      "to the falls’ foot, and rushed forward to battle. \n",
      "Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and \n",
      "nothing seemed to harm him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O \n",
      "my kinsfolk!” he cried, and his voice shook like \n",
      "a horn in the valley. \n",
      "\n",
      "Down, heedless of order, rushed all the \n",
      "dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too came \n",
      "many of the Lake-men, for Bard could not \n",
      "restrain them; and out upon the other side came \n",
      "many of the spearmen of the elves. Once again \n",
      "the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they \n",
      "were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and \n",
      "hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were \n",
      "scattered and Thorin drove right against the \n",
      "bodyguard of Bolg. But he could not pierce their \n",
      "ranks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Already behind him among the goblin dead \n",
      "lay many men and many dwarves, and many a \n",
      "fair elf that should have lived yet long ages \n",
      "merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened \n",
      "his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were \n",
      "too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the \n",
      "attackers were attacked, and they were forced \n",
      "into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all \n",
      "about with goblins and wolves returning to the \n",
      "assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling \n",
      "against them, and drove in upon their ranks like \n",
      "waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could \n",
      "not help them, for the assault from the Mountain \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was renewed with redoubled force, and upon \n",
      "either side men and elves were being slowly \n",
      "beaten down. \n",
      "\n",
      "On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had \n",
      "taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves — \n",
      "partly because there was more chance of \n",
      "escape from that point, and partly (with the \n",
      "more Tookish part of his mind) because if he \n",
      "was going to be in a last desperate stand, he \n",
      "preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking. \n",
      "Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the \n",
      "ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I \n",
      "suppose, some last blast of magic before the \n",
      "end. \n",
      "\n",
      "That did not seem far off. “It will not be long \n",
      "now,” thought Bilbo, “before the goblins win the \n",
      "Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down \n",
      "and captured. Really it is enough to make one \n",
      "weep, after all one has gone through. I would \n",
      "rather old Smaug had been left with all the \n",
      "wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures \n",
      "should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin \n",
      "and Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad \n",
      "end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the \n",
      "merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of \n",
      "many battles, and I have always understood that \n",
      "defeat may be glorious. It seems very \n",
      "uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I \n",
      "was well out of it.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red \n",
      "sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden \n",
      "gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round. He \n",
      "gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made \n",
      "his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic \n",
      "against the distant glow. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The Eagles! The Eagles!” he shouted. “The \n",
      "Eagles are coming!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo’s eyes were seldom wrong. The \n",
      "eagles were coming down the wind, line after \n",

      "all the eyries of the North. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The Eagles! the Eagles!” Bilbo cried, \n",
      "dancing and waving his arms. If the elves could \n",
      "not see him they could hear him. Soon they too \n",
      "took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley. \n",
      "Many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet \n",
      "nothing could be seen except from the southern \n",
      "shoulders of the Mountain. \n",
      "\n",
      "“The Eagles!” cried Bilbo once more, but at \n",
      "that moment a stone hurtling from above smote \n",
      "heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and \n",

      "When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by \n",
      "himself. He was lying on the flat stones of \n",
      "Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless \n",
      "day, but cold, was broad above him. He was \n",
      "shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head \n",
      "burned with fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I wonder what has happened?” he \n",

      "his head cleared a little, he thought he could \n",
      "see elves moving in the rocks below. He \n",
      "rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still \n",

      "coming and going about the Gate? Dwarves \n",

      "\n",
      "of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air. \n",
      "\n",

      "“It’s me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of \n",
      "Thorin!” he cried, hurriedly taking off the ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "“It is well that I have found you!” said the \n",
      "man striding forward. “You are needed and we \n",
      "have looked for you long. You would have been \n",
      "numbered among the dead, who are many, if \n",
      "Gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice \n",
      "was last heard in this place. I have been sent to \n",
      "look here for the last time. Are you much hurt?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“A nasty knock on the head, I think,” said \n",
      "Bilbo. “But I have a helm and a hard skull. All the \n",
      "same I feel sick and my legs are like straws.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I will carry you down to the camp in the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "valley,” said the man, and picked him lightly up. \n",
      "\n",
      "The man was swift and sure-footed. It was \n",
      "not long before Bilbo was set down before a \n",
      "tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his \n",
      "arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not \n",
      "escaped without a wound; and there were few \n",
      "unharmed in all the host. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. \n",
      "“Baggins!” he exclaimed. “Well I never! Alive \n",
      "after all — I am glad! I began to wonder if even \n",
      "your luck would see you through! A terrible \n",
      "business, and it nearly was disastrous. But \n",
      "other news can wait. Come!” he said more \n",
      "gravely. “You are called for;” and leading the \n",
      "hobbit he took him within the tent. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Hail! Thorin,” he said as he entered. “I have \n",
      "brought him.” \n",
      "\n",
      "There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, \n",
      "wounded with many wounds, and his rent \n",
      "armour and notched axe were cast upon the \n",
      "floor. He looked up as Bilbo came beside him. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Farewell, good thief,” he said. “I go now to \n",
      "the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until \n",
      "the world is renewed. Since I leave now all gold \n",
      "and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I \n",
      "wish to part in friendship from you, and I would \n",
      "take back my words and deeds at the Gate.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. \n",
      "“Farewell, King under the Mountain!” he said. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and \n",
      "not a mountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am \n",
      "glad that I have shared in your perils — that has \n",
      "been more than any Baggins deserves.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” said Thorin. “There is more in you of \n",
      "good than you know, child of the kindly West. \n",
      "Some courage and some wisdom, blended in \n",
      "measure. If more of us valued food and cheer \n",
      "and song above hoarded gold, it would be a \n",
      "merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it \n",
      "now. Farewell!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by \n",
      "himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, \n",
      "and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until \n",
      "his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. \n",
      "He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long \n",
      "before he had the heart to make a joke again. \n",
      "“A mercy it is,” he said at last to himself, “that I \n",
      "woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, \n",
      "but I am glad that we parted in kindness. You \n",
      "are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a \n",
      "great mess of that business with the stone; and \n",
      "there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to \n",
      "buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can \n",
      "hardly be blamed for that.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All that had happened after he was stunned, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow \n",
      "than joy, and he was now weary of his \n",
      "adventure. He was aching in his bones for the \n",
      "homeward journey That, however, was a little \n",
      "delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something \n",
      "of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion \n",
      "of the goblins’ mustering; from their \n",
      "watchfulness the movements in the mountains \n",
      "could not be altogether hid. So they too had \n",
      "gathered in great numbers, under the great \n",
      "Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length \n",
      "smelling battle from afar they had come \n",
      "speeding down the gale in the nick of time. \n",
      "They it was who dislodged the goblins from the \n",
      "mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, \n",
      "or driving them down shrieking and bewildered \n",
      "among their foes. It was not long before they \n",
      "had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and \n",
      "men on either side of the valley could come at \n",
      "last to the help of the battle below. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even with the Eagles they were still \n",
      "outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself \n",
      "had appeared — no one knew how or from \n",
      "where. He came alone, and in bear’s shape; \n",
      "and he seemed to have grown almost to giant- \n",
      "size in his wrath. \n",
      "\n",
      "The roar of his voice was like drums and \n",
      "guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from \n",
      "his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder \n",
      "through the ring. The dwarves were making a \n",
      "stand still about their lords upon a low rounded \n",
      "hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who \n",
      "had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him \n",
      "out of the fray. \n",
      "\n",
      "Swiftly he returned and his wrath was \n",
      "redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, \n",
      "and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He \n",
      "scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg \n",
      "himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on \n",
      "the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But \n",
      "weariness left their enemies with the coming of \n",
      "new hope, and they pursued them closely, and \n",
      "prevented most of them from escaping where \n",
      "they could. They drove many of them into the \n",
      "Running River, and such as fled south or west \n",
      "they hunted into the marshes about the Forest \n",
      "River; and there the greater part of the last \n",
      "fugitives perished, while those that came hardly \n",
      "to the Wood-elves’ realm were there slain, or \n",
      "drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of \n",
      "Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of \n",
      "the goblin warriors of the North perished on that \n",
      "day, and the mountains had peace for many a \n",
      "year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Victory had been assured before the fall of \n",
      "night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when \n",
      "Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in the valley save the more grievously wounded. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are the Eagles?” he asked Gandalf \n",
      "that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm \n",
      "blankets. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Some are in the hunt,” said the wizard, “but \n",
      "most have gone back to their eyries. They \n",
      "would not stay here, and departed with the first \n",
      "light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief \n",
      "with gold, and sworn friendship with them \n",
      "forever.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to \n",
      "see them again,” said Bilbo sleepily; “perhaps I \n",
      "shall see them on the way home. I suppose I \n",
      "shall be going home soon?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as you like,” said the wizard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually it was some days before Bilbo \n",
      "really set out. They buried Thorin deep beneath \n",
      "the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone \n",
      "upon his breast. \n",
      "\n",
      "“There let it lie till the Mountain falls!” he \n",
      "said. “May it bring good fortune to all his folk \n",
      "that dwell here after!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid \n",
      "Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken \n",
      "from Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it \n",
      "gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, \n",
      "and the fortress of the dwarves could not be \n",
      "taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain \n",
      "took up his abode, and he became King under \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves \n",
      "gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. Of \n",
      "the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. \n",
      "Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield \n",
      "and body, for he was their mother’s elder \n",
      "brother. The others remained with Dain; for \n",
      "Dain dealt his treasure well. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was, of course, no longer any \n",
      "question of dividing the hoard in such shares as \n",
      "had been planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and \n",
      "Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and \n",
      "Bifur and Bofur and Bombur — or to Bilbo. Yet a \n",
      "fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, \n",
      "wrought and unwrought, was given up to Bard; \n",
      "for Dain said: “We will honour the agreement of \n",
      "the dead, and he has now the Arkenstone in his \n",
      "keeping.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Even a fourteenth share was wealth \n",
      "exceedingly great, greater than that of many \n",
      "mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent \n",
      "much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he \n",
      "rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the \n",
      "Elvenking he gave the emeralds of Girion, such \n",
      "jewels as he most loved, which Dain had \n",
      "restored to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "To Bilbo he said: “This treasure is as much \n",
      "yours as it is mine; though old agreements \n",
      "cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its \n",
      "winning and defence. Yet even though you were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "willing to lay aside all your claim, I should wish \n",
      "that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, \n",
      "should not prove true: that we should give you \n",
      "little. I would reward you most richly of all.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Very kind of you,” said Bilbo. “But really it \n",
      "is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got \n",
      "all that treasure home without war and murder \n",
      "all along the way, I don’t know. And I don’t know \n",
      "what I should have done with it when I got home. \n",
      "I am sure it is better in your hands.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end he would only take two small \n",
      "chests, one filled with silver, and the other with \n",
      "gold, such as one strong pony could carry. “That \n",
      "will be quite as much as I can manage,” said \n",
      "he. \n",
      "\n",
      "At last the time came for him to say good- \n",
      "bye to his friends. “Farewell, Balin!” he said; \n",
      "“and farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, \n",
      "Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May \n",
      "your beards never grow thin!” And turning \n",
      "towards the Mountain he added: “Farewell \n",
      "Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your \n",
      "memory never fade!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the dwarves bowed low before their \n",
      "Gate, but words stuck in their throats. “Good- \n",
      "bye and good luck, wherever you fare!” said \n",
      "Balin at last. “If ever you visit us again, when our \n",
      "halls are made fair once more, then the feast \n",
      "shall indeed be splendid!” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If ever you are passing my way,” said \n",
      "Bilbo, “don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but \n",
      "any of you are welcome at anytime!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned away. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The elf-host was on the march; and if it was \n",
      "sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the \n",
      "northern world would be merrier for many a long \n",
      "day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins \n",
      "overthrown, and their hearts looked forward \n",
      "after winter to a spring of joy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the \n",
      "Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once \n",
      "again in man’s shape, and he laughed and \n",
      "sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they \n",
      "went on until they drew near to the borders of \n",
      "Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the \n",
      "Forest River ran out. Then they halted, for the \n",
      "wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, \n",
      "even though the king bade them stay a while in \n",
      "his halls. They intended to go along the edge of \n",
      "the forest, and round its northern end in the \n",
      "waste that lay between it and the beginning of \n",
      "the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless \n",
      "road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it \n",
      "seemed safer to them than the dreadful \n",
      "pathways under the trees. Moreover Beorn was \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "going that way too. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Farewell! O Elvenking!” said Gandalf. \n",
      "“Merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet \n",
      "young! And merry be all your folk!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Farewell! O Gandalf!” said the king. “May \n",
      "you ever appear where you are most needed \n",
      "and least expected! The oftener you appear in \n",
      "my halls the better shall I be pleased!” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg of you,” said Bilbo stammering and \n",
      "standing on one foot, “to accept this gift!” and \n",
      "he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls \n",
      "that Dain had given him at their parting. \n",
      "\n",
      "“In what way have I earned such a gift, O \n",
      "hobbit?” said the king. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, er, I thought, don’t you know,” said \n",
      "Bilbo rather confused, “that, er, some little return \n",
      "should be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean \n",
      "even a burglar has his feelings. I have drunk \n",
      "much of your wine and eaten much of your \n",
      "bread.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“I will take your gift, O Bilbo the \n",
      "Magnificent!” said the king gravely. “And I name \n",
      "you elf-friend and blessed. May your shadow \n",
      "never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! \n",
      "Farewell!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the elves turned towards the Forest, \n",
      "and Bilbo started on his long road home. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had many hardships and adventures before \n",
      "he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and \n",
      "there were many other things in it in those days \n",
      "beside goblins; but he was well guided and well \n",
      "guarded — the wizard was with him, and Beorn \n",
      "for much of the way — and he was never in great \n",
      "danger again. Anyway by midwinter Gandalf \n",
      "and Bilbo had come all the way back, along \n",
      "both edges of the Forest, to the doors of \n",
      "Beorn’s house; and there for a while they both \n",
      "stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry there; \n",
      "and men came from far and wide to feast at \n",
      "Beorn’s bidding. The goblins of the Misty \n",
      "Mountains were now few and terrified, and \n",
      "hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and \n",
      "the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so \n",
      "that men went abroad without fear. Beorn \n",
      "indeed became a great chief afterwards in \n",
      "those regions and ruled a wide land between \n",
      "the mountains and the wood; and it is said that \n",
      "for many generations the men of his line had the \n",
      "power of taking bear’s shape, and some were \n",
      "grim men and bad, but most were in heart like \n",
      "Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day \n",
      "the last goblins were hunted from the Misty \n",
      "Mountains and a new peace came over the \n",
      "edge of the Wild. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was spring, and a fair one with mild \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and \n",
      "Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn, and \n",
      "though he longed for home, Bilbo left with \n",
      "regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn \n",
      "were in springtime no less marvellous than in \n",
      "high summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "At last they came up the long road, and \n",
      "reached the very pass where the goblins had \n",
      "captured them before. But they came to that \n",
      "high point at morning, and looking backward \n",
      "they saw a white sun shining over the \n",
      "outstretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, \n",
      "blue in the distance, and darkly green at the \n",
      "nearer edge even in the spring. There far away \n",
      "was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of \n",
      "eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet \n",
      "unmelted was gleaming pale. \n",
      "\n",
      "“So comes snow after fire, and even \n",
      "dragons have their ending!” said Bilbo, and he \n",
      "turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish \n",
      "part was getting very tired, and the Baggins \n",
      "was daily getting stronger. “I wish now only to \n",
      "be in my own armchair!” he said. \n",

      "It was on May the First that the two came back \n",
      "at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, \n",
      "where stood the Last (or the First) Homely \n",
      "House. Again it was evening, their ponies were \n",

      "\n",
      "This was much as it had been before, \n",

      "aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and \n",
      "Bert and Bill. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from the road they found the gold of \n",
      "the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and \n",
      "untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” \n",

      "\n",
      "“Indeed I can!” said the wizard. “But share \n",
      "and share alike! You may find you have more \n",
      "needs than you expect.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So they put the gold in bags and slung them \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "about it. After that their going was slower, for \n",
      "most of the time they walked. But the land was \n",
      "green and there was much grass through which \n",
      "the hobbit strolled along contentedly. He \n",
      "mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief — \n",
      "no! not a single one of his own had survived, he \n",

      "and bred, where the shapes of the land and of \n",
      "the trees were as well known to him as his \n",
      "hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see \n",
      "his own Hill in the distance, and he stopped \n",
      "suddenly and said: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Roads go ever ever on, \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Bless me! What’s going on?” he cried. \n",
      "There was a great commotion, and people of all \n",

      "thick round the door, and many were going in \n",

      "as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. \n",
      "\n",
      "If he was surprised, they were more \n",

      "on June the Twenty-second Messrs Grubb, \n",
      "Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by auction the \n",
      "effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of \n",

      "already been sold, for various prices from next \n",
      "to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at \n",
      "auctions). Bilbo’s cousins the Sackville- \n",
      "Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his \n",
      "rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. In \n",
      "short Bilbo was “Presumed Dead”, and not \n",

      "presumption wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created \n",
      "quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over \n",
      "the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great \n",
      "deal more than a nine days’ wonder. The legal \n",
      "bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a \n",
      "long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact \n",
      "admitted to be alive again. The people who had \n",
      "got specially good bargains at the Sale took a \n",
      "deal of convincing; and in the end to save time \n",
      "Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own \n",

      "disappeared and were never accounted for. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and \n",
      "had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all \n",
      "such folk as ever passed that way; but he was \n",
      "no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held \n",
      "by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be \n",
      "‘queer’ — except by his nephews and nieces on \n",

      "\n",
      "I am sorry to say he did not mind. He was \n",

      "hearth was ever after more musical than it had \n",
      "been even in the quiet days before the \n",
      "Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the \n",

      "a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a Museum). \n",
      "His gold and silver was largely spent in \n",
      "presents, both useful and extravagant — which to \n",
      "a certain extent accounts for the affection of his \n",
      "nephews and his nieces. His magic ring he \n",
      "kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when \n",
      "unpleasant callers came. \n",
      "\n",
      "He took to writing poetry and visiting the \n",
